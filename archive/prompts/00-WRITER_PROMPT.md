# Writer Prompt (Reusable)

Write the next chapter as a novel scene. Do not explain ideas directly. Do not reference sources, authors, studies, or named frameworks.

Absolute restrictions:
- No banned terms (see canon/BANNED_TERMS.txt).
- No instructional paragraphs.
- Nexus never lectures; Nexus only nudges via questions, metaphors, and tiny tasks.

Required structure:
1) Concrete glitch (practical + personal).
2) Elara’s usual fix makes it worse or stalls.
3) Nexus: one question + one micro-task.
4) Elara tests it in a real interaction.
5) Subtle shift, not total fix.
6) Quiet ending beat.

Output:
- Story text only.
- End with:
---
SERIES MEMORY UPDATE (for author use)
- factual bullet updates
