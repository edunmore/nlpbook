[0.00 - 7.00]  Okay, any questions about that? Yes?
[7.00 - 10.00]  Is it usually a very close family member who's the major part?
[10.00 - 14.00]  Is it usually a very close family member who's the major part? I think it's,
[14.00 - 21.00]  let's put it this way, I think it's useful if it is. I think it's often someone, the
[21.00 - 25.00]  person knows, or it's a nondescript part, like some people will often describe a part
[25.00 - 29.00]  as, well this part is sort of yellow and looks like a fuzzy ball or something like that.
[29.00 - 108.94]  Thank you. it's often someone the person knows, or it's a nondescript part. Some people will often describe a part as, well, this part is sort of yellow and looks like a fuzzy ball or something like that. Or they'll personify it, and then it will be someone, you know, it doesn't have to look exactly like the mother. It could be, if it's not a close family member, should you search further? No, I'm just looking, No, we're talking about not the overall. We're talking about simply the standard parts integration. If it's not a close family member, my, no, I don't go any further with it. All I'm looking to do is to integrate the parts. So I don't want to give either part any more solidity or substance than um than i need to right so i wouldn't do that the parts that we have are parts that we've created during our existence they're not parts that you know like how we go back uh in time yeah okay and we back past into generations. So what you're saying is how far back could parts go? Yeah. I haven't really worried about that. Oh. I figure parts could go as far back as they do. And since the notion of parts is a sort of timeless model, parts are sort of atemporal, aren't they? Although each of the parts had a moment of creation. But as we work with parts, we don't really worry about where they came from
[108.94 - 113.36]  necessarily. Now, that's not always the case because sometimes a part, if you're working
[113.36 - 116.88]  with a single part, there may be a significant emotional experience that the client needs
[116.88 - 122.86]  to clean up with the parts integration, in which case we'd use timeline therapy. But
[122.86 - 228.00]  typically, parts are sort of atemporal. In the prime directives of the unconscious mind, we mentioned that there's two types of memory storage. One is temporal, which is your timeline, and the other is atemporal. Parts are sort of atemporal, even though they did have a moment of creation. But typically, I don't worry about where the part came from or how long it's been there. I just go for integration. Is this appropriate to use along with timeline therapy when it comes to disease process? I think it's all... When we get to our model of therapy, which is Section 5, page 1, we'll look at what you do during a standard NLP or timeline therapy intervention. I think it's really appropriate to do parts integration at any time when it comes up, and I think it's also appropriate to check for parts to see if they're part of the process of creating the presenting problem. So if they come up, yes, definitely, and if they're part of the problem the problem then definitely and always check on them to make sure that if there or if there's any incongruency at the unconscious level so if there's somebody who believes in in your regular conversation that part of them um continues to be sick because that's just the belief system that they've adopted then you would use use the parts integration at that time. I actually, I would actually probably force a part. So I would say, so a client says to me, the only reason I'm sick is because it's part of my belief system. Is that what you're saying they would say? Yeah. And I would say, oh, so there's a part of you that believes you should be sick. For example, if somebody felt that their, you know, their mother had cancer at a certain age and then they knew that they were going to get it or believed inside themselves that that was something that was looming
[228.00 - 229.80]  in their future. I actually worked with a client
[229.80 - 286.78]  like felt that their, you know, their mother had had cancer at a certain age and then they knew that they were going to get it or believed inside themselves that that was something that was looming in their future. I actually worked with a client like that, very specifically. Her sister had died of cancer and one of her major beliefs was she was going to die of cancer. As far as I know, today she still doesn't have it. And what one of the, and this was, I would say, about six years ago now. And one of the things that we did was we took out any belief with regards to her, any belief in her past, with regards to her having cancer, which we used timeline therapy with. So if a client has a certain set of beliefs, then I would use timeline therapy process for getting rid of limiting decisions. And that's described in the timeline therapy tape set. What essentially we would, so the client says I believe I'm going to get cancer, I would say when did you decide that? And we'd work from the limiting decision that occurred that created that. Now if I was concerned that the client was also incongruent, then I would also, I would also look and see if there was a part. So I'd say, oh, so part of you believes you're going to get cancer
[286.78 - 287.52]  and part of you doesn't.
[287.54 - 288.04]  Is that right?
[288.76 - 290.56]  And then the client would say either yes or no.
[291.56 - 294.90]  Or if I felt there was some incongruency that required some parts work,
[294.98 - 296.82]  then perhaps I would look at it that way.
[297.90 - 298.60]  Okay, thanks.
[298.74 - 299.02]  Great.
[299.52 - 300.38]  I was just wondering.
[301.36 - 305.00]  It's a good thing to wonder. It is. And that means...
[305.00 - 307.00]  And that means I'm going to learn something here.
[307.00 - 312.00]  With this one, would I use hierarchy of parts if, say, I had done a couple of parts
[312.00 - 316.00]  integrations and just felt that then I'm going to go for the big thing?
[316.00 - 320.00]  Like, when would you actually just jump in and go for the big guy?
[320.00 - 321.00]  Okay.
[321.00 - 345.14]  One of our graduates in Dallas, who is a clinical psychologist, who sees a number of people who are, should we say, he was actually the director of a mental health organization, used hierarchy of parts and felt that it was the only way to really get through to people who were institutionalized. So that's one way, if you keep working with a client who keeps having the same presenting
[345.14 - 485.86]  problem over and over again, then you would definitely go for hierarchy of parts. Also for you personally, if you ever wanted, I mean like, if you wanted to integrate all the various diverse incongruencies at the unconscious level, for whatever purpose, perhaps enlightenment or whatever, then you might do that. Because I think that that's also, you know, I think it's also one of the things to do. So there's two elements. One is working with people who are, say, even perhaps clinical. Another one is for your own personal enlightenment. And essentially it would be that, let's see, it would be perhaps you get a part that didn't want to talk to you or that didn't want to, that was recalcitrant perhaps, that didn't want to work with you. You could ask to talk to that part that's in charge of that part or the part that's in charge of that part. You could use it to integrate yourself or you could work with, and you may find you would need it for people who were, let's say, institutionalized, if you were doing work in that area. Okay, thank you. That's when you'd use it. Linda? I'd like to share this because for all of you that helped me get to a new level here, and I appreciate that. I've been working on my issues, and I know Tad knows that I've been working on it very much. And I came from a background of a lot of abuse, so those parts were all of that. But Tad and I have been working in group and creating your future and so forth, and I released the anger. Then I was on sadness, and he told me, just stay there if you want to be sad so i did i got through that one and been working down that way so um the funny thing is that they really were the parts are just like lined up and they were waiting to be told what to do and i hadn't reached that stage so maybe perhaps if you're working with someone you've been clearing a lot of their emotions for them and you know they have a background of many years of of abuse this is a wonderful way. I really feel like everybody got together here and I am one person. I really am one person now. Thank you very much. You bet. Definitely. Excellent, excellent, excellent. Yes. Since you've brought it up, I wanted to know how you would do this with yourself i would have someone else do it probably
[485.86 - 505.14]  that's just me some people are very capable of working on themselves and there is a technique which we're going to get to in advanced submodalities which will allow you to do some similar things on yourself with yourself, but we're not there yet.
[505.14 - 509.38]  So that is coming. Personally, I'm sort of, I don't know, inherently
[509.38 - 516.26]  lazy we could say, or laid back, or whatever you want to say, to where I really prefer
[516.26 - 521.18]  to work with someone else. However, there is a system where you can work
[521.18 - 527.24]  with yourself, and we'll get to that in the advanced submodalities, which is in two days. Yes.
[527.24 - 528.24]  Male Speaker 1
[528.24 - 529.24]  I would say more to some of the asking for the name of the car.
[529.24 - 530.24]  Male Speaker 1
[530.24 - 531.24]  Yes.
[531.24 - 532.24]  Male Speaker 1
[532.24 - 533.24]  Yes.
[533.24 - 534.24]  Male Speaker 1
[534.24 - 535.24]  Yes.
[535.24 - 536.24]  Male Speaker 1
[536.24 - 537.24]  Yes.
[537.24 - 538.24]  Male Speaker 1
[538.24 - 539.24]  Yes.
[539.24 - 540.24]  Male Speaker 1
[540.24 - 541.24]  Yes.
[541.24 - 542.24]  Male Speaker 1
[542.24 - 543.24]  Yes.
[543.24 - 544.24]  Male Speaker 1
[544.24 - 545.24]  Yes.
[545.24 - 546.24]  Male Speaker 1
[546.24 - 547.24]  Yes.
[547.24 - 548.24]  Male Speaker 1
[548.24 - 549.24]  Yes.
[549.24 - 550.24]  Male Speaker 1
[550.24 - 526.44]  Yes. There is a system where you can work with yourself, and we'll get to that in the advanced submodalities, which is in two days.
[527.04 - 527.14]  Yep.
[527.54 - 545.70]  What's the importance of asking for the name of the part? Have you asked for the name of the person? In this write-up, that's actually the best way to say it. It's a run-on sentence, and it really seems to work. So is it important for the person to come up with a name for the part? No, because, again, as with most quantum linguistics,
[546.02 - 565.88]  we're not actually asking the client to say anything unless we are. No, you know what I'm saying? The client has to fully consider what we're asking them. Yes. So that's really the main thing for this. We saw a whole bunch of demos here, and we're going to take a few more questions, and we're going to do an exercise. Yes?
[566.70 - 569.94]  The question I had is, when you do parts integration,
[571.42 - 574.84]  you're doing it specifically for one problem, okay?
[574.84 - 578.52]  Now, if parts are aligned in a hierarchy,
[579.72 - 583.12]  what would be the point of doing a specific problem
[583.12 - 585.54]  if you can blow it all out with a hierarchy?
[585.78 - 586.62]  Excellent question.
[587.16 - 588.36]  That's really a good question.
[589.86 - 591.40]  Let's look at wall chart number 11.
[591.50 - 593.06]  I just happen to have this already made up for you.
[593.86 - 594.44]  And here's the thing.
[594.98 - 596.52]  Client comes in with a presenting problem
[596.52 - 598.08]  which is in the center of this called P.
[599.30 - 604.02]  If we go to the highest controlling part,
[645.46 - 647.98]  we may be working on P and we may be working out here also. Now, it's okay for us to ask for a higher level generalization from P, from this particular part. So we could say, but if we go too far beyond the boundaries of the presenting problem, we run the risk of changing things for the client beyond what the client expected. For example, literally, if you went to the highest controlling part without warning a person, you could literally have the person go to the mountain and become the Buddha, which they would probably be happy about, but it would probably be the last client from that family you ever got or the last client from
[647.98 - 666.66]  that business you ever got, and they would go, well, they went to this person, and they went back, and they joined an ashram and started meditating and shaved their head. That's really strange. You don't want to go see him. And, in fact, there could be unexpected effects from chunking up too high. We'll see this again and again in several different places
[666.66 - 689.12]  when there's a warning about how far to go in terms of chunking up. So, I would, my, my rule of thumb personally is if it never comes up for the client or the client never asks me, then I do not go beyond the boundaries of the client that the client has set as being the parameters of the presenting problem. In some cases, I will look for a higher level presenting problem, and we were just talking
[689.12 - 686.98]  about hierarchy of ideas. as being the parameters of the presenting problem. And in some cases, I will look for a higher-level presenting problem.
[688.06 - 690.04]  And we were just talking about hierarchy of ideas.
[690.14 - 691.80]  Remember I said this is called logical type.
[692.28 - 694.60]  I will look for a higher-level presenting problem
[694.60 - 696.22]  in the same logical type,
[696.66 - 700.08]  but to not go beyond the parameters
[700.08 - 701.64]  of the context in which it appears.
[703.26 - 704.52]  Because literally, if you blow...
[704.52 - 785.76]  Like, for example, you could have people quitting their jobs like you could someone could go in for money not being able to make enough money they could end up feeling that money wasn't important they could end up quitting their job and literally going off and and sort of dropping out and and quite frankly that might not support them for where they were at so if you go too far in terms of chunking up you'll go outside the boundaries of the context and i think it's safer to stay inside the boundaries now if if you have someone who comes to you and says you know i want to be enlightened then you go far out that's cool i've got total you know license let's let's see what we can do but interimly if a client comes to you and says i i want to have better relationships or or this or this, or whatever the presenting problem is, then you probably ought to stay within the same logical type of that. That's my opinion. So if you went to the controlling part and integrated all the parts, you might have some experiences which were unpredictable. That's the only reason to not go beyond those parameters. Okay? So being you already did that work with Linda, you already had the clearance to go ahead and... Yeah, I said to Linda, or I said to everyone, who would like to look at integrating a lot of parts at the unconscious level? And I already mentioned what the possible results could be, so. Good enough for me. Yeah.
[808.86 - 945.56]  So I personally felt that the ecology was present, and I think you ought to look very much at ecology before you do that. We're going to recommend that before you do any work like this, of a global nature, that you take a detailed personal history with a claim. This is part of the master timeline therapy training, and for those of you listening to the tapes, it's on the master timeline therapy tape set. would recommend a detailed personal history, and then with that in mind, you have a direction to go in, or you have an idea of where to move. Now, here's a caveat, too, by the way. If you go for hierarchy of parts and you go for integrating a lot of different parts, if you haven't gotten rid of a lot of negative emotions at the unconscious level, you may also have to deal with those. I mentioned that in passing as we started, but let me just be real specific. If a client has trauma or abuse and you attempt to integrate all the parts that were part of that, if you haven't released the negative emotions that were underlying that, you'll have to deal with those immediately. And I mean in the process of integrating those parts, those emotions will have to be dealt with one way or another, and that may indicate timeline therapy. So you should be prepared for that as we do this next exercise. And you should ask your partner in this exercise, is there any trauma and abuse in your past? Because in terms of, in terms of doing this, we haven't gotten to our timeline therapy segment in this class yet. And if there are a lot of unresolved negative emotions at the unconscious level, then those may also have to be dealt with, in a sense, and handled. So that's another caveat on going for all the parts. And with Linda, I'd seen her in enough recent trainings, I knew pretty much where she was at. I'd seen her at the Secret of Creating a Future, and we talked during the accelerated practitioner and I had a sense that she'd integrated enough of the negative emotions she actually was dealing with some specific things and I knew exactly what they were so I was prepared to do timeline therapy with her on the spot if she needed it and I thought for a moment she was gonna actually and then she didn't so it was cool yeah okay yep I noticed when you were working on me and you said are there any more parts that would like to join in right the answer was some but not all and i felt like there were some out there that wouldn't mind but didn't want to right so i'm just wondering in that case with a client um do you try to bring the whole lot in at once or do you just work on the ones that want to be there great question if the hands are coming together usually what i do is allow the hands to continue i don't i'm not going to stop the hands from coming together so i allow the hands to simply come together like that and the ones that are out there that don't want to integrate then that's fine now
[945.56 - 951.22]  if the hands were not coming together then i would say all the parts that would like to integrate or
[951.22 - 956.28]  once part of this larger whole have them check their highest intentions etc if the hands were
[956.28 - 960.20]  not coming together then we look for all the different parts highest intentions and make sure
[960.20 - 964.12]  they were the same and then then the hands could come together and all of those other parts could
[964.12 - 986.88]  integrate but usually when the client's hands are coming together, I'm not going to stop the process. Because to me, it's an unconscious process that's going to happen, and I don't want to slow it down. So in that sense, I'm not going to get into the detail of does this part want to integrate or not. We'll just have all the parts that want to come in and integrate to be able to do that. That may just be me or the way I feel about it.
[988.38 - 988.46]  Like if the client's hands are coming together,
[1046.04 - 1089.20]  even if I suggested it it means to me that there's a significant a significant percentage of the parts at the unconscious level ready to get to do it and get done with the process right away so that's why i did what i did if the client then says well there are still some parts out there and they would like to integrate, you'd do it again. Make sure they get their highest intention. Make sure they get their highest intention handled. Make sure all the parts that were once part of the larger whole are clear that they were and are of the same highest intention. And then integrate them all again. Yep. But that's not going to stop the presenting problem from working. I mean the presenting problem still worked because we integrated the two major parts that created that presenting problem that gave us the wide range of dichotomy on wall chart number ten, the two Y parts, the two widest apart parts. The others, that's just sort of, to me that that's just sort of icing on the cake or gravy on the mashed potatoes, kind of, to let, to say to the other parts, hey, come on, let's, let's all get together. And it gives us a little more broad-based integration to occur a little, a little more deeper integration at the unconscious level. But I don't feel that it's absolutely necessary to the process either. It's just kind of a a nice thing to add on to me. One of the rules of thumb is if it ain't broke, don't fix it. So with your integration, the presenting problem, which occurred, if the presenting problem is no longer a problem, then I wouldn't dig it up again. It's like you plant a flower, the flower starts growing. You're not going to go, gee, I wonder if I need to dig this up and replant it. It's going good. Just let it grow, right? My rule of thumb is if you test and the client's congruent,
[1088.36 - 1092.58]  then test again the next day, see if the client's still congruent. If the client's
[1092.58 - 1102.32]  still congruent, then pretty much you're done. My point of view also about all this is that parts integration in and of itself is almost never the only intervention I use.
[1102.32 - 1105.70]  So when you say did this work, did this specific parts integration work or did this one work
[1105.70 - 1105.00]  or did this one work, did this specific parts integration
[1105.00 - 1126.78]  work, or did this one work, or did this one work, for me, parts integration is something that happens in the context of a much larger process that goes on, which is all on section five, page one, the entire model of therapy, which we'll get to, and the entire model of doing a specific integration, which we'll get to, or a specific, you know, entire personal breakthrough session or whatever, which is coming up, but since you guys are so quick,
[1126.90 - 1285.14]  it won't be here anyway until we get there. When they start to get to the threshold of their boundaries when you're chunking up, and they begin to lose... Isn't that fun to watch that, by the way? Yeah, but they also seem to go sideways a lot. They do. Some people and the i the problem i usually have is breaking through to getting up to past the threshold to blow it out so you can get the highest intention yeah sometimes i'll actually point out to the client hey you're chunking sideways like i like i did today or i just i want to point out to you that's a chunk down or if they don't know nlp i'll go hey you know i just want you to know that's more specific and what we're looking for is a little more abstract so what's the purpose and i'll stay then at the previous purpose did you notice i i didn't take the chunk down as for what purpose i stayed at the previous purpose which was the higher level chunk and if you stay there and you just sort of gently persist with that eventually the part will come up and go outside the boundaries. Yeah. Okay, so it's time to do an exercise. And sometime in the future, when you see a client, you'll actually be called upon, I think, to make a decision as to what particular intervention you're going to use. So we have a number of interventions which are possible here, and they are the standard parts integration, which is on page 332, or the linguistic parts integration, which is on page... You know, I'm sorry these parts are so spread out in the notebook. I was going to put all the parts in the same place, but part of me wouldn't let me, so. So the linguistic parts integration is under linguistics, and the parts parts part is with values, so. Anyway, the linguistic part integration is on 247, and the hierarchy of parts is on 248. What I'd like you to do is to get together with a client, pick a presenting problem, and go ahead and do one of these, whichever one would be most appropriate, and we're going to do this in groups of two. So get with someone else, and we're going to do this in groups of two. One thing that I want to point out is that at this point it's possible that if you pick a presenting problem which is a major presenting problem and if you haven't done a fair amount of timeline therapy, you may have to do timeline therapy to solve the presenting problem you're trying to integrate. And we'd like to ask you to save that for when we get to timeline therapy. Because in terms of the time we've got,
[1285.14 - 1288.40]  it's not going to work for us to pull out the stops
[1288.40 - 1290.32]  and stop the training and have a couple of hours
[1290.32 - 1291.16]  of timeline therapy.
[1291.16 - 1294.50]  So be aware of what your presenting problem is
[1294.50 - 1295.90]  in terms of the depth of it.
[1295.90 - 1296.96]  We're going to get to timeline therapy
