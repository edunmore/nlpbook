[0.00 - 45.06]  okay who else let's do someone else yvonne what's the relationship between these three boxes well they're all the same they're all the same box but one happens to be slightly different in the way it's turned but they're all the same box all the same shape size and how long have you been doing what you're doing well I've just given that a lot of thought and in most of my life things have changed quite quickly within 18 months and now I've found that disconcerting but I have just had a business for seven years and I've given that up and I lived in the house for seven years and I decided it was time
[45.06 - 49.36]  for a change so on your little chart there you check they're mostly the same and there are some
[49.36 - 62.58]  differences but by the way I want to point out to you if you look at the boxes I'm going to turn them upside down or look at them that way you'll notice they're not actually the same size the boxes are actually for those of you if you want to look at the boxes just for fun if you turn the box sideways, you'll notice that they're not actually all the same size.
[64.84 - 66.16]  It's just an optical
[66.16 - 67.30]  delusion. Yes, Joe?
[68.48 - 165.04]  Well, i looked at the boxes that way and they looked like they were the same size to me now i did notice they look to me to begin with as the same but with a difference how long what's your uh how long have you been doing what you're doing what i'm doing right now about 18 months but months. But before that, the average is about seven years. I was in the Army for six, with Schlumberger for six, with my previous employer for nine, and I got increasingly disgruntled with them, and it was just a matter of time before I left. Well, yeah, nine years would be. So your average is going to be about seven years. About seven, yeah. It is about seven. Okay. Yes, Joel. Ted, I have a question. What would you do with, or what would you interpret an answer that says, these three boxes make up a bigger rectangle? I've gotten that. Yeah. These three boxes make up a bigger rectangle. I would ask them, what's the relationship between what you're doing on the job now and what you were doing a year ago? And or what's the relationship between these three coins? The bigger rectangle could be a sameness thing. I don't know, with further questioning, the fact that they don't even see three boxes could be a sameness thing. Or they could be looking at what's not there, in which case it's a differences thing. But I'm not just going to suggest that. Joel's trying to, he's going, ooh. Okay. I've always done projects. And if I was in a project that went on for longer, I moved house, you know, I built a house. I had to keep going in some direction.
[166.50 - 166.72]  So what's the relationship between these two offices?
[167.50 - 167.66]  I think they're all different.
[168.12 - 168.32]  They're all different?
[168.64 - 168.98]  Yes.
[185.52 - 185.94]  And how long have you been on the projects that you've done? Well, the first job I did was 18 months, but I moved from one job on to the next job within the job. And in the second job, you could apply for jobs within the company. So I kept moving. I moved to a different city, then I moved back again, then I moved about two jobs up in the company.
[245.14 - 245.40]  So then I was on my way to move. I met my husband, so I decided to marry him and give up moving. That was a good way to avoid moving, yeah? Well, I had to do something. Do you rearrange the living room often? Yes, yes, yes. How often? I have a need to... Things must a place for everything. How often do you rearrange your living roughly? Once a month? No, I'm not that anxious for housework. Oh, that's good. 18 months. 18 months, yeah. Okay, that's good. So there's a real clear example of differences. Anyone else? Well, now I mainly see the similarities, but I've never lasted more than 18 months in a job until I started working essentially for myself and found myself in Tucson one week, L.A. the next, Seattle the next, then I loved it, and what I learned from that was being independent was what I really needed to do.
[248.56 - 248.62]  Yeah, it is possible that another metaprogram could come into play,
[262.70 - 263.24]  as we pointed out earlier. It is also possible that if a person whose total sameness goes into a company where there's too much change, they will overreact. So that's also possible. So someone whose total sameness, I mean, I've worked with total... Oh, I meant total sameness. Yeah, but someone who is total sameness,
[264.94 - 267.02]  they go into a company where there's a lot of change or a lot of uncertainty, they'll blow out of there in weeks
[267.02 - 269.08]  because, or there's too much change,
[269.16 - 265.62]  or even if they hear... Total sameness. Yeah, but someone who is total sameness, they go into a company where there's a lot of change or a lot of uncertainty,
[265.74 - 267.00]  they'll blow out of there in weeks
[267.00 - 269.08]  because, or there's too much change,
[269.16 - 285.58]  or even if they hear that there's too much change, they could blow out very quickly. So that's another issue to the sameness. Someone who has real heavy sameness will have a problem with too much change in the environment. So it's possible that that could happen.
[285.66 - 288.24]  So you're going to have to look and see which one is so for you.
[288.24 - 353.22]  You might have had really high independence needs and had to work individually and that could be why you're you had to change jobs I saw sameness sameness was some difference and when I owned a business everything was the same but the variety the differences was really important now that i'm an employee i want consistency i want to know what am i supposed to do and quit changing it right so but but how long you been on this job oh two years so just just probably somewhere around seven years seven years of self-employed yeah probably about seven years you're going to have to get some kind of changes for yourself. Just might change your desk around or put a different picture on the wall or get another office or something like that. Probably in government they'd set that up for you too. I mean, just changing offices might occur. Okay, let's look at the emotional stress response. Tell me about a work situation that gave you trouble. This is number 13, and we're on page 3-8. Tell me about a work
[353.22 - 358.32]  situation that gave you trouble. Who wants to do that? By the way, if you're not doing
[358.32 - 361.28]  it in a work context, just about a situation that gave you trouble. Tell me about a work
[361.28 - 364.32]  situation that gave you trouble, though. We're doing it in a business context.
[364.32 - 365.72]  It was several years ago.
[365.78 - 367.98]  I was working with this horrible person.
[384.62 - 384.86]  Is that associated or disassociated? By the way, Sun's plugged right into it. Look at her face. She's already in a state, in that state. All you have to do is look and see if the person's associated or disassociated, whether she's associated, we're done.
[387.32 - 388.12]  And you don't have to get any more information than that even.
[385.08 - 388.40]  I mean,
[388.42 - 405.10]  that's all you need. You can go right on to the next question. Okay, let's, let's have someone who's a thinker. Who would be a thinker in this case? Okay, David, talk to me. I got into a situation, I got into a development I was in for six years, got a million-two
[405.10 - 426.04]  in debt, and it took me a while to fight myself back out. Very uncomfortable situation. But I made the decision quickly, and once I was in, six, seven years is really average with me. Yeah. So this was a situation that gave David trouble. Notice he really didn't associate into the state of being in trouble. He described
[426.04 - 427.30]  it, but not particularly associated.
[444.42 - 446.00]  So that was good. And you could hear the difference in the voices too, so that's great. Excellent. Okay. Time storage we got. This is fun. Let's hear about the modal operator sequence. Let's hear your modal operator sequence. How did you get up this morning? What did you say to yourself? What did you say? I say got to get up, got to get up, twice. Got to, got to, got to get up, got to get up, twice.
[446.22 - 447.10]  Write that down twice.
[447.52 - 448.40]  It's time to get up.
[448.68 - 526.78]  It's time to get up. It's time. Okay. Ryan? It's light outside. I want to get up and go for a walk. Okay. I want to. Want to is the modal operator. I want to get up. Who else? Who else? Who else has got an interesting one? We have another day to play. We have another day to play. And what's the modal operator in there, though? Have to, have to play. Well, some folks have a modal operator of, which is necessity, but it's not necessity. Like, for me, when I want to do something that's so, that I want to do it so much, I have to, I have to. Well, actually, I gotta. So it's so compelling that I gotta, right? Okay, so model operator sequence is very simple. You just write it down, whatever you're looking for. All right, so what I'd like to do next is to demonstrate an eight minute, or eight minute or so, metaprogram elicitation. And I'd like to demonstrate it exactly the same way that we did it when we did business consulting. And we actually, you can take a lot longer than eight minutes to elicit these metaprograms, which, you know, if you wanted to, then you certainly could, but if you could do it in eight minutes, you'd get a heck of a lot of information in a very short period of time. So we've gone through all the questions. You
[526.78 - 605.06]  guys can see what you think. You've got one form here, which you can use to do the elicitation. And you also have, certainly it's called the Metaprograms and Values Inventory mpvi 1 slash 88 and that's the that's the form we're using and that's just one page two sides you can use that form you can copy it no problem okay so who would like to have their metaprograms elicited let's do Ian let's do Ian Murray I'd love to have you but we'll save you for something Ian come on up so Ian what do you want in may sound a little weird to you,
[605.14 - 608.00]  but the fact is that I'm not really interested in what you think,
[608.62 - 628.84]  particularly as much today as in how you think. And so I may, to be honest with you, interrupt you at any moment and go on to the next question, but the idea is just to sort of move through these, if that's okay with you. Okay. Okay. So why are you choosing to do what you're doing? Because I like, well, when I get out of bed in the morning,
[628.92 - 632.96]  I guess I have some objectives to do,
[632.96 - 640.46]  and I kind of like exactly the setup that I've got now.
[640.60 - 642.62]  I guess I just like doing that.
[642.78 - 644.12]  Great, and how do you know when you've done a good job?
[667.56 - 667.64]  I mean, do you just know inside yeah I've heard those feelings yeah and how do you know someone else is good at what they do I look at their results uh-huh and how often does someone have to demonstrate competency to before you're once one time mm-hmm okay do you know what you need to do to increase your chances for success on a given job or a given project?
[667.84 - 668.36]  Yes.
[682.10 - 682.28]  And do you know a good way for someone else to increase their chances? Yes. Do you find it easy to tell them or not so easy? Easy to tell them. Easy to tell them. Okay. When you come into a situation, do you usually act quickly after sizing it up? Quickly? You don't do a detailed study of all the concepts?
[683.60 - 684.12]  No, you're pretty quick. Yes, okay.
[685.40 - 685.48]  All right, got that.
[746.40 - 749.00]  Tell me about a work situation in which you were the happiest at one time event. I got a lot of them. Okay. Let me just pick one. Well, I guess the last financial year, we ended up very successful. Yeah, tell me about that. Well, our balance sheet and profit loss were pretty good by the time we took out the end-of-year figures. Uh-huh. And had a meeting. Yeah. And tell me more. Tell me more. Want to know all the details? Oh, just a little bit more. Yeah, we... Who's we, Who's we, by the way? I made a lot of changes last year, and as a company, we met a lot of goals, and I guess the end result, the single most result, is that we ended up really well on the profit and loss statement.
[750.08 - 750.80]  What's your favorite restaurant?
[751.40 - 751.66]  I have several.
[752.34 - 754.20]  Tell me about it.
[757.66 - 762.66]  I like a variety of food. I have two Chinese restaurants, Greek.
[764.44 - 845.02]  Ian, pick one of those and tell me why that's your favorite, if you would. In each of those, there's a lot of activity. I mean, they have a band or there's a lot of people. They're very popular restaurants, and they usually have difficulty even getting a seat in their reservations. Great. So if we were going to do a project together, would you need to know all the details first or the big picture first? Big picture. Big picture, and would you really need to know the details? No. No. Okay. What's the relationship between these three boxes? One up, two on the side. What's the relationship between what you're doing this year and what you're doing last year in the company? I've undergone a lot of change this year. So is it somewhat different, a lot different? A lot of difference. Is there more difference than sameness? Much more difference than sameness. Okay. Tell me about a work situation that gave you trouble. Not reading the marketplace, relying upon a large customer and they underwent
[845.02 - 846.18]  a lot of change themselves.
[847.02 - 863.38]  They went Chapter 11, a U.S.-based company, and they did the Chapter 11 for protection, not for bankruptcy. That's good. That's the lie. No, that's good. Thank you, thank you. Can you tell me where your past is? Yeah. Where's your past? Right out there. Where's your future? Up there, three times.
[863.52 - 863.72]  Uh-huh.
[864.68 - 867.44]  And what did you say when you got up this morning?
[867.76 - 868.00]  Mm-hmm.
[868.78 - 869.68]  Remember when you got up this morning?
[869.68 - 887.86]  Absolutely. Where's your past? Right out there. Where's your future? Out there, three times. Uh-huh. And what did you say when you got up this morning? Mm-hmm. Remember when you got up this morning? I absolutely have to get out of bed. I have to, huh? Okay. Okay. Okay. Great. How long did that take? Five minutes? Great. Thank you, Ian. give him a hand I'll go back and talk about him in just a minute okay so that was
[887.86 - 906.62]  a five minute. Isn't that funny? I had a sense of urgency. I thought I was running late. Okay, so let's go back and I'll give this to you in a minute. And thanks for helping me fill this out. So what did you guys get from Ian in terms of direction metaprogram?
[907.66 - 908.18]  Toward.
[908.90 - 911.80]  There might be some away from,
[913.08 - 916.88]  and one of the away froms might be change.
[917.22 - 919.40]  If I really needed to calibrate that,
[919.48 - 922.94]  I might ask him what the issue with change was.
[923.32 - 924.68]  Remember, what is change?
[924.74 - 946.88]  It's a comparative. The word change itself is going to be a comparative. Change compared to what? So I might just automatically classify that as a big T with a little bit of A, or I might classify it. I'd have to ask him first. But it's possible that that was the case. He also has a high need for activity, which oftentimes is away from boredom.
[947.46 - 950.56]  What did you guys get on the Reason metaprogram?
[951.66 - 952.18]  Possibility.
[952.48 - 953.24]  Frame of reference?
[954.82 - 955.34]  Internal.
[955.98 - 956.46]  Convincer?
[957.50 - 958.02]  See.
[958.78 - 959.54]  And how many times?
[959.62 - 960.48]  Well, he told us, didn't he?
[960.52 - 961.02]  One time.
[961.46 - 962.36]  Management direction?
[964.42 - 988.20]  Self and others. Would you say he's active or reflective? Oh, active, yeah. Boy, he didn't even wait for the question to be over. Right? Would you say, now, this is a question. Would you say that he's independent management or team? And what was the reason you said management, by the way? We. Good, good, good, good. Yeah. So every time that he said that, he said we.
[988.28 - 990.84]  But I didn't hear him talk about that.
[990.84 - 996.12]  So I would think I would classify him as kind of in between management and independent.
[996.22 - 997.42]  He's got a real high independence needs.
[997.88 - 1000.58]  I didn't hear him say specifically I did this.
[1000.76 - 1001.80]  I did hear him say that, yeah.
[1003.22 - 1005.10]  He said I did this and say that, yeah. He said, I did this, and so forth.
[1005.16 - 1006.84]  Yes, but when he was talking about,
[1007.30 - 1008.28]  he talked a lot about we.
[1009.06 - 1011.76]  So, and work preference?
[1013.84 - 1014.62]  Work preference?
[1016.30 - 1018.02]  Systems, and I went back and checked people
[1018.02 - 1019.44]  when I got down to favorite restaurant.
[1020.52 - 1023.06]  So, what do we get in his favorite restaurant?
[1024.44 - 1025.72]  Activity is number one, then what? I would say people's number two, restaurant? Activity is number one.
[1025.80 - 1026.10]  Then what?
[1027.36 - 1028.68]  I would say people's number two,
[1028.74 - 1030.00]  and then something else is number three.
[1032.30 - 1033.54]  Yeah, or things,
[1033.64 - 1035.12]  because when you talk about menus,
[1035.22 - 1036.94]  you're talking about things, right?
[1038.32 - 1040.54]  And global to specific,
[1040.62 - 1041.86]  or specific to global, or what?
[1042.26 - 1043.40]  Global, yeah, okay.
[1147.62 - 1185.32]  And relationship metaprogram. I would say differences with exception, I'd want to, at least based on the answer we got, there was some differences with exception. When you say almost all different, or roughly that's what you said, right Ian? Almost all different, yeah. There is some sameness, but again he's in his own company so he's going to be on the job longer because he can create the amount of change he needs. Emotional stress response? Dissociated? Modal operator sequence? Have to. Attention direction? There's no question, you just observe and what you're looking is for the compulsive others person if you're going to be hiring for that but what did you get for Ian I would say self he was he was in terms of how I would calibrate I would check I would say both because he was calibrating me for response and he was also calibrating the room a little bit, you guys in the room, and he was also internal for self. So I would give him a check of both. And that took five minutes. Do we have a lot of information here, buddy? Yeah. We have a tremendous amount of information in a very short period of time. Something that's useful. We probably know him a lot better now probably than a lot of people know him. And if we spend some time talking to him, and so what I used to do, by the way, when we owned the consulting firm, was I used to take each of these for every single client, we used to get one of these forms filled out for every single client that we had. And then I would put it on a, not a spreadsheet because it was in my date. It wasn't day timer but it was in my calendar book. And it would fold out to eight and a half by 14, right? So it would fold out to a long thing and then across the left side was the names of the people and across the top was direction metaprogram and also all the values, all the direction metaprogram, all of the client's decision and motivation strategy, model, operative sequence, and all of it was on one piece of paper, all of the clients. So when I'd flip open the thing to talk to somebody in another office, or one of our clients, or one of our consultants, at night if I was at home talking to a consultant, I'd flip open my book and I'd look at this person. I'd go, okay, this person is toward
[1185.32 - 1204.70]  and a little bit away from possibility metagram, internal frame of reference. And then I would use my language in that way. So I'd use my language to feed back to them the kind of information they needed to have. And I've given you an example of how to feed back the language, and probably you might want to, page 311, starts on page 311
[1204.70 - 1205.32]  you might want to
[1205.32 - 1205.74]  actually
[1205.74 - 1206.58]  if you're going to use
[1206.58 - 1207.44]  metaprograms a lot
[1207.44 - 1208.22]  and you want to use them
[1208.22 - 1208.98]  to motivate people
[1208.98 - 1287.74]  you might want to, page 311, it starts on page 311, you might want to actually, if you're going to use metaprograms a lot and you want to use them to motivate people and fit right inside their own processes and so forth, I would memorize these if I were you. They work real well. We taught the consultants this, so a client that has toward and away from, here are our goals and objectives and here's what we want to avoid, toward client, here are our goals and objectives and just some ideas about how to frame your languaging for the client. Okay, so let's do an exercise. Okay, an eight minute or actually since I did it in five you guys can do it in ten or less. We'll take ten minutes a piece and what I would say, I tell you, when I used to say you, when I went into the engineering firm and I said to these guys, we met with everybody in the firm one by one, one on one. And what we said to them was, this is really neat, we said, I don't really care what you think. For purposes of this interview, I'm not interested in what you're thinking, I'm only interested in how you're thinking. And I've got to tell you, at least half the mid-level managers that I talked to went like this. Okay, let's talk. And I said, I'm only interested in patterns. I'm only interested in process. And I may actually interrupt you in your content and move on to the next question. If I've got enough information, I'll just move right on to the next question. And I can't tell you how relieved
[1287.74 - 1303.82]  they were when you'd say that to them. So if you do a metaprogram solicitation with someone, say that to them. Say, for purposes of this interview, we're not interested in content as much as we are process. We're not interested in what you think. We're interested and how you think. And so let me just ask you some questions that will determine that.
[1304.32 - 1308.78]  Okay. Any questions about the process? I think we've gone over this enough. Let's just do it.
[1309.16 - 1368.80]  Groups of three uh 10 minutes a piece if you're done earlier we'll start again earlier and if you're listening to the tapes uh if you would please uh go ahead and stop the tape now and do the exercise all right welcome back glad you guys are back are there any questions on number six management direction filter we had some confusion on what self but not others uh describes because you said that that was the way you described was someone who just said who am i to tell them i didn't want to tell other people what to do my interpretation was of c was if you found it not so easy, that would be a person's self but not others. Who am I not to, yes, exactly right. Sort of like I'm not really, it's not that easy for me to do it, no matter what my motivation is. We're saying the same thing. Oh, okay. But there was some misunderstanding about the terminology. So if I find it not as easy to, you know, some people just go, okay, this is how you need to do it.
[1368.94 - 1365.52]  I don't find it not as easy to, you know, some people just go,
[1365.94 - 1385.24]  okay, this is how you need to do it. I don't find it that easy to do that, so I would be self, but not others. Okay, yeah. It's actually kind of different, and it really is. One person could say, and maybe this is just what you said, but one person could say, I don't know how to tell them, And one person would say, it's not my place to tell them.
[1385.28 - 1386.56]  That's really two different things.
[1386.88 - 1467.38]  You know, like I don't know how, and I don't know how to tell them and one person would say it's not my place to tell them that's really two different things you know like I don't know how and I don't really give two hoots this is a PG rated tape so the answer is if they answer no so that they if they yes if they answer yes, no, then it's self. If they answer yes, yes, no, then it's self but not others. I'm talking about the list of questions here. Right. We're saying the same thing. We're all saying the same thing. Self only is, do you know what you need to do to increase your chances for success on a job yes do you know a good way for someone else to increase their chances no that's self only and self but not others is do you know what you need to do to increase your chance for success on a job yes do you know a good way for someone else to increase their chances yes do you Do you find it easy to tell them they're not so easy? Not so easy. That's self, but not others. Okay? And often that's, and I added that for the people from the 60s who said, who am I to say, that is not the only condition. I'm sorry if I implied that was the only condition under which that would occur. Other questions? I have a question on number 13 and 14.
[1527.92 - 1531.84]  I know you said earlier that these aren't supposed to generalize or interact towards each other, but then... Let's say there's no necessary relationship where if an answer to one is X, the answer to the other has to be X. Oh, okay. um i also noticed that um i guess in your practitioner training you mentioned that if you're in time then you usually when you recall the memory from the past then you associate into it and then if you're through time because it's in front of you you're generally disassociated that's that's correct um however it is possible to have somebody with an with a with an emotional stress response that's associated but have them still be through time because i've had i have had through time managers who who got really upset um when you ask that question when they when they you know like associated in the thing so it is it is possible for a through time person to associate's also true. Okay. This is the end of tape 21, side b.
