[0.00 - 47.60]  Let's move on to modeling, and our modeling page is, it's in section four, and it's page five. We're also going to put up slide 113, just for fun. One time, I think it was several years ago now, I had a fellow come to me and he said, I wanted to learn modeling. He said, can I, what do you suggest that I do? And I said to him, well, because at that point I had taught some modeling trainings with, shall we say, one of the founders of NLP. But I said, you know, there's this modeling course.
[47.66 - 48.32]  Why don't you go take it?
[48.34 - 48.82]  And so he did.
[49.54 - 50.52]  And he came back and he said,
[50.58 - 51.66]  I really want to learn modeling.
[52.84 - 54.40]  Can you help me do that?
[54.44 - 55.26]  And I said, oh, yeah,
[55.34 - 57.14]  just come to our master practitioner class.
[57.20 - 58.60]  We'll spend about an hour and a half on it.
[59.44 - 60.66]  And you'll understand it totally
[60.66 - 105.02]  and then you'll be able to do them because he had to do it he came back from his modeling training which was two weeks and he couldn't really understand quite how to do it i'm not suggesting that we can shorten the time that it takes you to learn how to do this but my guess is that you already know how to do modeling um because you've taken all of the nlp trainings that you've taken and those of you who are listening to the tapes um you guys have sat with me now for, hmm, how many tapes is that as I look at the box? That could be, you know, 20 or could be longer than that even, you guys. So anyway, you already know modeling. I mean, my sense is that you've got enough information to do modeling. And let me tell you that there are long modeling trainings, and I've taught some with, like I said,
[105.06 - 105.92]  some of the founders of NLP.
[126.94 - 227.48]  And the fact is that modeling is unfortunately disarming, or fortunately disarmingly simple and very easy to do once you know how to do NLP. Do you guys know how to do NLP? Yes. Good, good. Okay. Just checking. So since you know how to do NLP, let's link to what you already know. And so this guy comes back and I said, just sit through our Master Practitioner Training and what we'll do is we'll use sort of breaking a board as an example of how to do modeling and we'll get it installed at the conscious and unconscious level. So I want to talk to your conscious mind first, if I may, and I'm not going to make a lot of suggestions about your ability to do modeling while we do this, so that you can use that later. I'm also not going to necessarily consciously install the process at the unconscious level so that you'll be able to unconsciously model it any time you want. You know, it's really funny, when I began to, there's actually been a number of projects that I've done that included modeling. And I've done some projects which were formal, I've been actually hired by some folks, was hired by some folks to do some modeling. Those projects turned out successfully, I'd like to tell you a little bit about those. But I think you already know, you already have an experience of some of my personal modeling projects. One of them was published in the book Timeline Therapy and the Basis of Personality as the book Timeline Therapy and the Basis of Personality, which is essentially modeling how a person forms their personality. Timeline Therapy was actually an informal modeling project where, and what happened to me was it was kind of simple. I don't know if I've told you this story before or not. If I have, don't stop me. Don't stop me. I was standing outside of a training, much like this one actually, and I was talking to one our course participants, and she said, you know, I have all this anger, and I said
[227.48 - 242.66]  about this certain event in my past, and I said, oh, that's interesting. Can you float above your timeline? She knew her timeline. And go back to, so you look facing in the past and looking down at the event. And she said, I can do that. And I said, good, float back to directly above the event.
[242.92 - 243.46]  Can you do that?
[243.56 - 243.98]  She said, yeah.
[244.04 - 244.74]  I said, where's the emotion?
[244.84 - 245.58]  She said, it's down there.
[246.20 - 247.12]  I said, okay, fine.
[247.16 - 245.58]  Can you go back above the event. Can you do that? She said, yeah. I said, where's the emotion? She said, it's down there.
[246.20 - 247.12]  I said, okay, fine.
[247.18 - 248.54]  Can you go back before the event happened?
[250.90 - 251.82]  She said, yeah, I'm there.
[251.90 - 252.66]  I said, where's the emotion?
[252.74 - 253.38]  She said, it disappeared.
[253.48 - 261.88]  And I went, no, no, no, don't play with me now. Where did it go? She said it disappeared and I went, huh, that could be useful.
[261.88 - 267.12]  So modeling among other things is paying attention to what your clients do and
[267.12 - 268.62]  to what people do around you.
[268.62 - 266.82]  Modeling is, modeling doesn't have that could be useful. So modeling among other things is paying attention to what your clients
[266.82 - 366.48]  do and to what people do around you. Modeling is, modeling doesn't have to happen to where you go model this big necessarily important person. There's lots of things that could be modeling. Lots of things you could just look at and I noticed this one client of mine let go of all of her negative emotions about anger on a single event. And I went, well dang. And I'm not even from Texas, as you know. So, I am from the south though, but yeah, Honolulu. It's the furthest south major city in the U.S. And, you know, so the anger disappeared, and I thought, you know, gee, that could be useful. Because if one person can get rid of all of their anger, everyone can. If one person can get rid of a negative emotion, everyone can. And so it became the process of timeline therapy. That's really essentially how the process came about. I was just talking to someone, noticed what she did, emotions disappeared, and I don't think, to be honest with you, I don't think if I hadn't had the training and modeling that I would have been able to recognize things like that. Another thing happened. I was sitting here, sitting and actually doing therapy with a client, and the client said, I'm not congruent and everybody knows it. So I was talking to the client. Now this was, to be honest with you, this was like 1987. I'm talking to a client and the client says, I'm not congruent and everybody knows it. That was a presenting problem. I'm sitting there talking to the client, blah, blah, blah. And, you know, all of a sudden, he says, you know,
[366.52 - 369.02]  and it's really, it's a part of me that's making me incongruent.
[370.18 - 382.74]  So I said, oh, oh, there's a part of you that makes you incongruent. Yeah, and I said, what's the part's highest intention? And he said, perfection. And I, you know, I said to him, you know, anything less than total congruency
[382.74 - 383.44]  is not perfection.
[384.50 - 386.50]  And he went, what?
[387.20 - 388.52]  I said, yeah, anything less than
[388.52 - 386.50]  total congruency is not perfection. And he went, what?
[387.14 - 389.10]  I said, yeah, anything less than total congruency
[389.10 - 389.82]  is not perfection.
[389.88 - 391.78]  And he went, what?
[393.16 - 395.90]  And I said, anything less than total congruency
[395.90 - 396.76]  is not perfection.
[397.84 - 398.66]  And he goes,
[400.34 - 402.04]  I can't even think of that, he said.
[404.74 - 427.88]  Well, what did I have there? Prime concerns, non-mermits reverse, inductive language pattern. And to be honest with you, I'd thought about inductive language patterning, and I'd thought about non-mermits reverse, but had not codified anything on it. And he went, all of a sudden he goes, the part disappeared I went huh let me see what I wait a minute
[427.88 - 446.02]  what did I say anything less than so modeling doesn't have to be big time and formal you can if you if you can and then out of that came prime concerns and out of that came quantum linguistics And because I struggled to explain why it happened.
[446.88 - 545.00]  And from 1987 until probably 1993, I wasn't satisfied with my explanation, although I did have in 1989, I taught a segment of prime concerns, it was the first time I ever taught prime concerns, because I looked at what that client had done and began to teach the process. So modeling doesn't have to be something that you are going to go model someone formally. Now, I've also done formal modeling. I've also done formal modeling, and one of the interesting things to me, I want to just tell you two things as a result of really paying attention to certain things which we're about to discover. There's two things that happened to me, and I'm not suggesting they're going to happen to you. But one thing that happened was I started to be able to read books and notice what was happening in the mind of the writer. Now, I wasn't able to read those books at 10,000 words a minute to do that. But I was able to read those books at a reasonably decent speed, consider what the person was saying. And I remember I read Science and Sanity and I turned to page 21. And I looked at page 21 and I wrote down a process which I, at the top of my journal put language integration process and I actually wrote down the process. And I wrote down a whole series of steps, just out of the blue, whole series of steps and came back and actually did the process, this actually became the language integration process.
[586.36 - 594.26]  The language integration process is something that I developed that has to be done one-on-one, but actually strips off language, takes language off of the person, so to speak, allows them to literally experience themselves in the universe without language, and then hooks it back up in a way that gets rid of all the negative anchors at the deeper level. I don't like to do the process because it's very intense for the person doing it. Me, I mean. It's very intense for me, not for the client. The client actually has fun at it, but it takes a lot of thought process and takes about maybe five to ten hours to do, so it's a rather intense process. But the weird thing was I went back and looked at page 21 and it wasn't there. You know, the steps that I wrote down in my journal weren't on page 21. But somehow, you know, I said to
[594.26 - 598.66]  myself, your unconscious mind can organize everything that it hears at the unconscious
[598.66 - 603.80]  level or reads or sees and then all of a sudden the process can come out of that. That's what
[603.80 - 685.16]  happened to me. And it was simply a result of knowing these things. Now, another thing was really funny that happened because there's one more thing that came out of modeling. Modeling has been, as I mentioned, very valuable to me, personally. It's been very enriching and allowed me to develop some processes that probably I would not have otherwise done. I was actually sitting talking to, well, let's say somebody in Hawaii who knows the ancient, who knows the ancient ways. And he was just talking to me, and I wrote down in my journal a series of steps of what later became what we called the higher self-connection. Which essentially is connecting up, or actually not really connecting because in the Hawaiian system you're already connected to your higher self, but reawakening the connection to the higher self. And I ended up talking to this person and I don't know what we were talking about really, but I ended up with a series of steps in my journal about how to do that. And what I noticed was that as a result simply of the modeling processes, that a series of steps can come out of it and of course I modified them along the way and tweaked them and timeline therapies changed and prime concerns have changed and become more easier to do, as you guys have learned in this training,
[685.84 - 687.90]  and the higher self-connections become easier to do.
[688.80 - 690.08]  But if you pay attention,
[691.14 - 693.14]  and I'm not suggesting it even takes conscious attention,
[693.28 - 694.72]  but if you pay attention at some point
[694.72 - 696.52]  and end up with a series of steps,
[696.76 - 698.46]  you're likely to have done modeling.
[700.02 - 702.94]  My great hope for you is that you'll be able to take this
[702.94 - 704.72]  and anywhere where you find most excellent behavior,
[747.08 - 747.16]  you'll be able to take this and anywhere where you find most excellent behavior, you'll be able to duplicate it. And the truth is that all of our Huna trainings, all the Huna trainings we do, and we now do somewhere between four weeks of totally different material and eight weeks of totally different material that we now teach in all of the levels of Huna. And, and the entire process came out of, of my modeling either people in Hawaii who know the ancient ways or, or writings about the subject and actually turning them essentially into processes. So the other thing I want to tell you is that, that having taught master practitioner trainings for a number of years,
[749.54 - 750.80]  what I notice is that the students that we teach here actually go out and do the same thing.
[754.02 - 757.08]  And, you know, I'm not going to suggest that to you,
[757.22 - 761.00]  but if there were, he said just kind of hooking it in
[761.00 - 766.26]  and then pulling it, is that if you were to, you know,
[767.28 - 769.92]  begin to model something and ended up with a process
[769.92 - 825.00]  I'll see you do it. So what is the theory of modeling? The theory of modeling is that given a specific behavior, this is on page 4 or 5, given a specific behavior, ability, or skill that an individual can perform, one can replicate that behavior, ability, or skill in half the time it took to teach the skill originally. We start with the idea that all people are equal in terms of mental and physical capabilities, and the only differences are issues of motivation, values, beliefs, and attitudes, which drive one to be excellent, which is an independent variable in the training function, by the way, and either sticks or carrots as the motivation force. Now, the interesting thing is that all of what we have taught as NLP was created by the process of modeling. And remember we said on our first day that it's interesting how things in this training seem to come full cycle at certain points. I'm
[825.00 - 947.52]  not sure why that happens, but remember we said the first day that NLP is an attitude and a methodology that leaves behind a trail of techniques and modeling is that methodology. All of NLP came from somewhere else. All of NLP came from somewhere else. We already mentioned on the tapes the first day the notion of rapport coming from hypnosis. Before there was rapport in NLP, there was rapport in hypnosis, and it was in this magical, mysterious state that no one really knew how to get to, but from time to time you'd arrive at it somehow, and your client and you would be in rapport, and they would hear only you and see only your voice and accept your suggestions unconditionally. And NLP's great gift to hypnosis was they sat down with Erickson and figured out how he did rapport, which is exquisite. And what did they do? They just said, okay, well, here's this thing called rapport, which is what? A nominalization. And And what's the process, what's the process of getting rapport? You know, the truth is that the idea of stimulus response has been around since 1902, when Bill Twitmire wrote the knee-jerk reflex article in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Some of you remember Bill. No, you don't really, but you remember Ivan Pavlov, who followed up on Bill's work in 1904 and thus became behavioral psychology. Not Pavlov, but his work. And, you know, the weird thing is that anchoring, the notion of anchoring, or stimulus response anyway, has been around in the literature since 1904. And LP just simply said, okay, well, we've got stimulus response. What is the process by which a stimulus creates a certain response? And we said, okay. And so anchoring was born. And the notion came from, actually, they were looking at a videotape one time, I'm sure, and saw Dr. Erickson reach over and grab a patient on the foot.
[948.12 - 948.76]  He was in a wheelchair,
[948.94 - 950.50]  so he probably couldn't reach the rest of the patient.
[950.54 - 951.84]  But he grabbed the patient by the foot and he said,
[952.12 - 953.80]  every time I grab your foot like this,
[953.82 - 955.14]  it will help you go back into trance.
[956.88 - 959.20]  And then what they noticed when Dr. Erickson grabbed the foot,
[960.10 - 961.24]  the person went into trance.
[962.48 - 1085.08]  Useful. So the stimulus that causes you to create something, a pattern, a technique, may not be the same as how you put it together eventually, but one of the things that's important is that you have a reasonably good knowledge base about the thing which you're modeling. So for example, strategies. Strategies came from Pribram, Galanter, and Miller in the book Plans and the Structure of Behavior. It came right out of the TOTE model. And strategies was NLP's way of trying to explain, anchoring was how simple behaviors occur, and strategies were how more complex behaviors occur. So everything in NLP, and one of the things I've done personally is I've gone back and sourced or looked at what the source of each particular technique in NLP was in the literature as it was published prior to finding it in neuro-linguistic programming. But what I want to tell you is that the key, well let me tell you, just stop for a second. So imagine this, here I am, I'm in a bar in 1985, and you'll be interested in this. I was in a bar in New York City, and I think it was the Roosevelt Hotel, but it might not have been. It was definitely in downtown New York. And I'm looking across the bar at the piano player, no, not at the piano player, at Richard Vandler. And I said, I'm kind of, I was kind of a brash, sort of a student. And I looked at him, I looked at him and I had this wild idea, just this berserk idea. And I probably shouldn't have said it, but it was worth saying. And I said to him, you know, what if all of NLP was just suggestion, and you were keeping the conscious mind busy with the pattern while you slipped the suggestions into the unconscious mind? And he turned beet red, slammed his fist down on the bar and said
[1085.08 - 1085.94]  no
[1085.94 - 1087.70]  and I went
[1087.70 - 1088.50]  huh
[1088.50 - 1091.74]  oops
[1091.74 - 1094.76]  I'm in trouble now
[1094.76 - 1097.92]  and five minutes later
[1097.92 - 1098.88]  he looked over at me
[1098.88 - 1099.44]  and he said
[1099.44 - 1101.44]  just denominalize
[1101.44 - 1102.28]  the word suggestion
[1102.28 - 1108.70]  and then I got it
[1108.70 - 1165.42]  Thank you. denominalize the word suggestion. And then I got it. The key to modeling is denominalization. The key to modeling is denominalization. It's how all of NLP was created. And a nominalization is what? A pre-existing concept or idea which looks like a noun. So what do we got in an LP? We got sensory acuity, right? Where'd that come from? Erickson looks at his clients, tells his students to look at the clients. Now it's weird, it's weird. I have to admit that sensory acuity is weird, right? Because Freud told his students not to look at their clients. In fact, they'd put them on a couch and face away from the client so they couldn't see him. But I don't know if you know this, before Freud, people doing therapy with other people looked at their clients. But Freud changed things, and Erickson was the first person to say, look at your client. Look at your client. You can see lots of things. When we say, what did
[1165.42 - 1266.00]  he see? And one of the times Erickson, somebody said, Dr. Erickson, how did you know that client was in a trance? And he said, I could see the beating of her pulse on her ankle change its tempo. Huh. What does that mean? I think that means that Dr. Erickson had some powers of observation which went beyond those of the mere student that he was teaching. So, when we do denominalization, one of the things we're going to end up with is a process. Process. Right? Nominalization means turning whatever it is back into a process. Right? Whatever you got, whatever you're looking for, whatever you're looking at, turn it back into a process. Something to do. It's going to be a series of steps. What are the things we look at when we're doing modeling? We look at several things when we're doing modeling. And essentially what we look at is on slide 113, which is we look at the physiology, we look at the filter patterns, and we look at the strategies. That's a little simplified. Let's talk kind of specifically about this. And we emphasize different things when modeling different things. So for example, if you were modeling golf, or rollerblading, yes, even rollerblading can be modeled, then you'd probably have a little more emphasis on physiology, wouldn't you? But when they were modeling Dr. Erickson, one of the things they wondered, because I don't know if you know this, but when they met Erickson
[1266.00 - 1285.66]  in the first place, he was in a wheelchair. And one of the things they wondered was, are we going to have to duplicate that physiology? Well, fortunately, the answer was no. So when you do different things, there's going to be different emphases on different parts of this. So in sports, the physiology is going to be more important. In golf, for example, you're going to have to get the swing
[1285.66 - 1465.10]  with the left arm straight when you follow through the ball. It's probably pretty obvious, that's probably pretty obvious, but in sales, for example, you don't need to be as precise about the physiology as you do in playing golf. The filter patterns, the filter patterns include what? They include the beliefs and values, and the filter patterns generally are going to answer the question why. And we're also going to look at the strategies. And the strategies are going to include essentially what the person does inside their head. We could also call that the mental syntax. There's an order and sequence of what each person does inside their head as they do anything. And so what we want to do is we want to find that out. Okay, now let me just ask you guys a question. Then we'll go on and really talk about modeling here. Let me just ask you guys a question. Do you guys know how already to match and mirror people? Let me just find out. Yeah, is there anything with regards to matching and mirroring that you think you don't know? By the way, the answer is no. No, because in your practitioner training, what's the list of all the things you match and mirror? It's in your practitioner manual. It's in the notes. It's like, what do you match in mirror? You match in mirror spine, tilt of the head, breathing, voice, eye blinking. What else? Gestures. It's pretty simple, right? Yeah. Filter patterns. What does that mean? Filter patterns means what? Metaprograms. We haven't covered those yet, but we will. By the time you understand metaprograms, you'll know how to elicit the metaprograms. Also includes the four basic metaprograms, which are in the Myers-Briggs, which we'll talk about. Actually, that's our next segment, right after this segment. Filters are all, and filters provide the question of why. So the physiology is, by the way, physiology is what? Is the what? Yeah, what is the physiology? Oh, sorry, physiology is what? What? That's like who's on first, right? Remember that? That's right, I don't know. You got it, Murray. So physiology is what? Filter patterns are why. So the filter patterns are the why. And the strategies are the how. So it's why, what, how. And then the what if will be when we do it. Interesting, huh? Alright, so modeling, page 4-6. The first thing, I gotta tell you, the first thing, the first thing is you really need to find someone whose behavior is worth modeling. No, I mean really. I really mean that. No, I'm serious. If you were to model someone that had behavior
[1465.10 - 1507.32]  that wasn't worth modeling, what would you get? You'd get their behavior. People tell me all the time, I think I'm going to model so-and-so. I go, why would you do that? If you're going to model somebody, model somebody that's really, really, really excellent. Model somebody that's really, really excellent. In fact, that's a big problem in modeling, especially if you were ever to get hired to do modeling, as I have. Oftentimes you go to model someone and you may find that they're not all necessarily that excellent. That being the case, you need to find somebody that's really excellent. When the U.S. Army recruits... Actually, when modeling fails,
[1508.42 - 1510.18]  modeling fails for two reasons.
[1511.52 - 1513.86]  That is to say, if a modeling project
[1513.86 - 1515.26]  doesn't necessarily succeed,
[1515.66 - 1516.98]  it doesn't succeed for two reasons.
[1517.24 - 1519.36]  One is that the behavior is not worth modeling,
[1519.44 - 1520.52]  or they find someone to model
[1520.52 - 1522.24]  that didn't really produce excellent behavior.
[1522.68 - 1524.70]  When they did the U.S. Army modeling project
[1524.70 - 1526.02]  of modeling Army recruiters,
[1527.14 - 1528.82]  they did actually find out
[1528.82 - 1606.78]  Thank you for watching. someone to model that didn't really produce excellent behavior. When they did the U.S. Army modeling project of modeling army recruiters, they did actually find out that they had to model, and they found out, the problem is they found out in the middle of the modeling project. What they found out was they could not model an army recruiter who'd only been in one city. Because if he was in one city, his behavior might have been idiosyncratic to fit that city, and so if he moved to another city, he might not get the same results. Weird, huh? So you, they had to model, but unfortunately they didn't find that out right away. So in the middle of doing the modeling project when they already had hundreds of hours of videotapes, etc., they found out that they had to model a recruiter that was in two cities or more and had been successful. So finding a model of real excellence is important. Now, obviously, if you want to pick up a behavior such as board breaking, just find somebody that can do it, right? Well, I mean, being able to do it is excellence, right? Okay. And when you model this person, what you have to do is find their beliefs and values, their strategy or mental syntax and their physiology, and then you install it in yourself. Let me see. Let me just ask you guys a question. Do you know how to install beliefs in yourself?
[1607.88 - 1608.20]  Yeah.
[1608.24 - 1609.14]  Do you know how to install values?
[1609.20 - 1623.78]  Or you will, right, by the end of the training. Do you know how to install the rest of the filter patterns like metaprograms? Well, you will by the end of the training, right? Right. Do you know how to find out someone's strategy and install a strategy? Do you know how to elicit the submodalities
[1623.78 - 1626.98]  and do those yourself? Yeah? And do you know how to match and mirror
[1626.98 - 1628.88]  the person? Pretty simple.
[1628.88 - 1641.78]  And by the way, when I've taught modeling trainings, that's all they teach. I mean, they teach you how to elicit strategies, but it's the same strategy elicitation you already know. So the number three is you install it in yourself and you already know how to install Step number four is once you've installed it in yourself,
[1641.78 - 1644.78]  then you design a training that produces universal results.
[1644.78 - 1647.78]  I kind of think, you know, for my life, for me,
[1647.78 - 1667.28]  where I'm at is finding out stuff and then teaching it to people. That's real satisfying for me, so designing universal training is right up my alley, personally. Because I like to try out stuff and see if it works. Yeah? And of course, I think the stuff we tried out during this training that you guys got a chance to see, and we do, by the way, try
[1667.28 - 1682.72]  out stuff in every training, but in terms of the percentage of success, I think we've done really good in terms of trying out some stuff and seeing what the results were. Even in the stuff that was neurological drivers and anchoring and so forth, we had, I think, a real high success rate.
[1682.72 - 1684.96]  It was about 90%, roughly.
[1684.96 - 1687.98]  So that's good.
[1687.98 - 1707.26]  You design a universal training then, and then you train others. Once you've produced the training that trains others and you've succeeded at that, then you train trainers. And, of course, we've talked about them. So let's get specific.
