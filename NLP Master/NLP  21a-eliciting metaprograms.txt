[0.00 - 26.36]  okay let's move on to the convincer convincer is how do you know that someone else is good at what they do and then how often does someone have to prove competency to you before you're convinced so let's see if we can get a range of people here i just wanted to backtrack if you're in this industry where you work with clients isn't their satisfaction important more so than if you're looking at a company where the whole thing lauren's leveraging values here. I don't know what we're... What's up?
[26.90 - 42.80]  Well, I was just thinking, if you're working one-on-one with clients... Making a value judgment about what Ian just said? No, no. I was just thinking for myself. It would seem that even though I tend to be internally referenced, that their opinion suddenly becomes a lot more important than if I were running a company. the individual clients
[42.80 - 43.90]  might not be as important.
[44.70 - 44.90]  Yeah.
[45.60 - 47.36]  I think that all of these
[47.36 - 48.06]  metaprograms are going
[48.06 - 48.64]  to be contextual
[48.64 - 49.66]  in the way you answer them
[49.66 - 45.72]  in business. if I were running a company, the individual clients might not be as important. Yeah.
[47.90 - 48.64]  I think that all of these metaprograms are going to be contextual,
[48.86 - 50.08]  and the way you answer them in business
[50.08 - 61.96]  is going to depend on the job that you're in at the moment. Okay. Okay, so let's see. So how do you know that someone else is good at what they do? They have to do it every time. They have to do it? They have to show me every time.
[62.10 - 63.56]  So let's say that you were working with someone
[63.56 - 66.34]  and they made a sale,
[66.42 - 67.52]  but you wouldn't know they were any good.
[68.84 - 66.34]  So, like, if you were working with someone and they made a sale,
[66.42 - 83.98]  but you wouldn't know they were any good. So, like, if you were managing me and we had a training coming up and we had done eight years of great trainings, you'd say, but I don't know what you're going to do this time. Yeah. Yeah. It's going to grow. In a business that I owned, an auto body repair shop
[83.98 - 86.32]  I had guys that were so talented
[86.32 - 88.34]  but I had to check them every time
[88.34 - 105.10]  because it was like i don't feel like doing this today and i'd go by and there'd be a gazillion mistakes how many is that mitch is it more than three it's more than i can handle when the customer shows up when the customer shows up yeah i hear you it's all it's all external i can feel really about it, and the customer walks up and says,
[105.18 - 106.82]  here's the money, gets in the car, and never looks at it.
[107.20 - 124.58]  And he had a bill for six grand that took us three months, and he's got to show me every time. Okay, all right. Excellent, okay, okay, okay. Who else? Son? How do you know someone else is good at what they do? I've got to see him do it. And how often does someone have to prove competency to you before you're convinced?
[124.88 - 126.06]  A few times.
[126.32 - 127.00]  Like three?
[127.24 - 128.20]  Three, yeah.
[128.74 - 125.04]  Okay, so after that you'd know. I've got to see them do it. And how often does someone have to prove competency to you before you're convinced?
[126.04 - 126.32]  A few times.
[126.98 - 127.24]  Like three?
[128.20 - 128.58]  Three, yeah.
[130.08 - 130.60]  Okay, so after that you'd know?
[131.18 - 131.44]  Yeah, I'd know.
[131.68 - 131.78]  Okay.
[141.32 - 141.40]  I might recheck that I'd know. You'd know. Yeah. Okay, okay. Yvonne, how often does someone have to prove competency to you before you're convinced? Oh, well, how do you know someone else is good at what they do?
[141.92 - 142.10]  Let's start with that.
[146.34 - 146.56]  I have to see them do it and have a good feeling about the way they've done it.
[146.32 - 146.52]  Then I'm convinced they good at what they do? Let's start with that. I have to see them do it and have a good feeling about the way they've done it.
[166.10 - 166.20]  Then I'm convinced they can do what they can do, but then every time I see them, I have to get that feeling. So I'm in every time. Every time you have to get the feeling. Wow. Okay. So what is that? It's consistent, isn't it? I usually also get a sensing that somebody's doing something well.
[166.98 - 167.42]  How do you get that sensing?
[169.00 - 169.42]  It just feels right inside.
[166.10 - 166.18]  You feel it, okay. Okay, so that's, what is that? Consistent, isn't it? I usually also get a sensing that somebody's doing something well.
[166.98 - 167.50]  How do you get that sensing?
[169.00 - 169.34]  It just feels right inside.
[170.04 - 170.18]  You feel it, okay.
[170.62 - 184.78]  You feel it. I feel it. You feel it after you... After I've experienced what they're doing. Do you have to do it with them, or can you just see them do it? No, I could listen to a seminar or I could watch them, you know, their children or family or whatever.
[184.80 - 185.26]  Okay, that's good.
[185.32 - 189.28]  So you heard me just make sure that we got the correct rep system down for Susan.
[189.40 - 185.26]  Okay. or I could watch them, you know, with their children or family or whatever. Okay, that's good.
[185.32 - 189.28]  So you heard me just make sure that we've got the correct rep system down for Susan.
[189.44 - 189.56]  Okay.
[190.02 - 201.76]  And then usually it's once. Once. So one time. One time, and then after that you'd know they were good. Yeah. Great. Good. So I think we've got, oh, we don't have a period of time yet. Who's got a? Okay, David, so let's find out.
[201.88 - 204.58]  So how do you know someone else is good at what they do?
[204.68 - 207.48]  Well, I'm basically either automatic or first time,
[207.54 - 207.46]  but then I go back if I do continue to use them. Okay, David, so let's find out. So how do you know someone else is good at what they do? Well, I'm basically either automatic or first time,
[227.70 - 267.96]  but then I go back if I do continue to use them and check periodically what they're doing to make sure that they're consistent. Okay, but you accept it after the first time. Is there anyone who's not convinced for a period of time? No one, okay. Well, so someone who's not convinced for a period of time might say three months. Three months. This is also, by the way, in addition to being in business, is also useful in relationships. No, this is really useful in relationships. This answers the question of, by the way, guys, this answers the question of how often do you have to send your flowers? Every time. That's every time every time i can only answer for myself personally okay let's see oh yeah management direction is next management direction is next so there's three parts to management direction right there's three parts to management direction let's let's go back to mitch let's go back to mitch and and get his three parts to management direction. Let's go back to Mitch. Let's go back to Mitch and get his three parts to management direction.
[268.22 - 268.44]  You ready?
[268.60 - 268.80]  All right.
[269.18 - 272.72]  So, yeah, we're on page 3-5.
[273.08 - 277.64]  So, Mitch, do you know what you need to do to be a success on a given job or a given project?
[279.16 - 281.24]  In the job that I have now, yes, I do.
[281.54 - 282.68]  Do you know what someone else needs to do?
[284.34 - 286.20]  Yes, the same thing I have
[286.20 - 307.24]  to do. It's very consistent. It's a government job. We're not allowed to be anything other than employees. There's no room for creativity. That's what they want. So do you find it easy to tell a person you're working with that that's what they need to do? Oh, yeah. Okay. Because I'm aware of it, because I don't do it. Okay, so don't be creative, just do the Good job.
[307.24 - 308.24]  Right.
[308.24 - 309.24]  That's it.
[309.24 - 310.24]  Okay.
[310.24 - 311.24]  That's what I want.
[311.24 - 312.24]  Good.
[312.24 - 313.24]  All right.
[313.24 - 305.84]  So what is that? Because I'm aware of it. Because I don't do it. Okay, so don't be creative.
[305.92 - 306.42]  Just do the job.
[306.58 - 307.24]  Right, that's it.
[307.54 - 307.70]  Okay.
[308.46 - 308.58]  Good.
[308.90 - 309.74]  All right, so what is that?
[310.36 - 310.96]  Self and others.
[311.64 - 312.48]  Right, very simple.
[312.62 - 313.06]  Self and others.
[314.70 - 315.84]  Let's see if we can get an example.
[315.84 - 317.34]  Is anyone self-only?
[318.74 - 320.24]  Whoa, no one's self-only.
[321.24 - 365.18]  Is anyone others is anyone others only? Your sister is? She doesn't know what she needs to do but she can sure as hell tell you. Okay, well let me give you some examples. So self only is I sure know what I need to do. Others, I don't know what they need to do and I don't care. That's self only. And then others only is you know what you need to do to be a success? No, the boss tells me. And there are people like that. Do you know what you need to be a success? The boss tells me, I only do what the boss says. That's it. Yeah. And do you know what someone else needs to do? Oh, yeah, sure.
[385.70 - 385.94]  And do you find it easy to tell them? Very easy. That's others only. And then the final one is self but not others. And I had to add this because even though it seems redundant, because this happened when all the people from the 70s and 80s started hitting the workforce. And so, and the question is, you know what you need to do? Well, yes, I know what I need to do.
[387.46 - 387.82]  Well, do you know what someone else needs to do?
[385.70 - 425.88]  Well, yeah, sure, but who am I to tell them? Like, I, you know, let them, let them, you know, different strokes for different folks. Let them be their own. So, we added that for the, for the more recent people entering the workforce. Okay, that's management, that's management direction. uh action yeah, this is proactive, reflective, or both. So let's see. So when you come into a given situation, do you usually act quickly after sizing it up or do you do a complete study of all the consequences? A complete study of all the consequences. So you're proactive. Yeah, very proactive. Okay. Quickly.
[426.36 - 445.58]  Quickly. Yeah. So you're pretty quick. Yeah, walk in, sit, there's a problem. Okay, this is what we need to do. Yeah, let's get it done. Okay, is there anyone, anyone has to do a complete study? Let's see if we can get an answer. Oh, so you guys are all pretty quick. Oh, Joel. Oh, Joel. Okay. Okay, great. Okay, Joel, talk to me. I'm just going to study everything.
[445.80 - 446.16]  Everything.
[447.00 - 449.14]  And then think about it some more
[449.14 - 465.30]  before I can do anything. How long does it, and make list, how long does it take you to make a decision? It depends on how big it is. I mean, if it's a simple decision, I just think about it. Okay, yeah, right. But if it's a big decision, I may not even make it until I have to make it.
[465.44 - 565.60]  Okay, so in a given situation, you have to know everything about it. I've got to know everything, weigh the possibilities, all the consequences, before I feel I'm in a position to actually decide. So that's pretty simple. That's reflective. Pretty simple. Yeah, active or reflective, and definitely he's reflective. I'm a bit more impulsive, and it's really interesting listening to you because if I go shopping with my husband, we go through every single store for hours, and he never buys anything because maybe there's a better deal around the corner, you know? And I buy it before I even look at it. I buy it before I even look at it. Wait a minute. I i like that that's exactly like me and my girlfriend so we never go shopping because i've got to go through every single place to find exactly what i want when we went and bought a bed we i had to look at every single store in every single bed even though the second one was what i wanted and what we ended up buying good thing she was with you huh okay that's the action that's the action filter you can ask by the way one question and get the affiliation uh and the work preference uh pretty much in the same question so so let's see and the same the question is the same tell me about a work situation in which you were the happiest uh a one-time event rich tell me about a work situation in which you were the happiest. When I was flying. Okay. Tell me about it. It was a combination of independence and interdependence and fun and freedom and like that. Okay. So did we get a lot of information just then?
[566.42 - 567.60]  Yeah, we did.
[570.72 - 573.02]  Well, first of all, do we think he's going to be independent management or team?
[573.42 - 575.64]  Team.
[576.96 - 577.62]  I don't know. We'll see.
[579.22 - 579.28]  We'll see. We'll talk about that.
[582.64 - 645.28]  The question is, is a seminar leader independent or team? Is an airplane pilot independent or team? Probably. We'll have to see. At best, he's going to be management. At least, he'll be independent. He's probably, things, people, or systems. He's probably not people, because we didn't hear him say anything about we didn't hear him say inter about, we didn't hear him say interdependence, but that could be systems. And we did hear, and probably things. So let's see. So tell me more. This, by the way, I just wanted to stop this in the middle and give you the thought process that I would go through as I heard that. So you're flying what? What's up? Flying people and uh and enjoying the process of flying and flying them um staying in new places meeting new people uh and just uh enjoying it okay just because he's flying people places doesn't mean that's a team i still don't hear anything about team do you no but i do now hear about people and i hear about what else do you? No. But I do now hear about people. And I hear about, what else
[645.28 - 665.14]  do you hear? Places. Seeing new places. So we've got people and places. We may have systems, I don't know, but we definitely still have independent, don't we? Because I don't hear team. It could still be management, but I don't hear that yet. Okay, so we'll ask some more questions.
[666.14 - 684.56]  Do you like your plane? Yeah. I have to. Very fun. Okay, so tell me more. It's not why I don't like the plane. You have to like your plane. You have to like your plane. You have to like your plane. Okay. So how important is the process of flying to you? It's a combination of creativity and freedom and technology, So it's important.
[684.76 - 686.98]  So when he says technology, I'm going to vote for systems.
[688.70 - 709.54]  Probably. Okay. So one of the things you can do is we could ask questions forever, but notice what you hear and notice that we've actually done the next three things here. But we can cross-check Rich by asking him about his favorite restaurant. So we can do a cross-check and see what we get and see if we're correct on our primary interest
[709.54 - 712.34]  filter by simply asking, you know, so Rich, tell me about your favorite restaurant.
[714.02 - 714.42]  Chinese.
[714.88 - 715.06]  Yeah?
[715.50 - 717.36]  One from column A, one from column B.
[718.12 - 722.58]  I love it. What is that? Systems. Okay, why else do you like it?
[722.94 - 725.14]  It's real social. You can share.
[746.26 - 747.52]  What's that? People. Get like five things with five people and you can split. Whoa, that's systems, isn't it? So I think we were pretty accurate on our intuition, right? Would you? Because when we cross-check it with that, we got people and systems. That's pretty good. Activity. I might even vote for activity, but I'm not sure yet.
[749.08 - 748.64]  And we can go on and ask more and
[748.64 - 752.84]  more questions and get more and more information. We'll at least know what he's paying attention
[752.84 - 756.44]  to. Right? Okay. Yes, ma'am.
[756.44 - 759.92]  When you ask about activity, is that personal involvement or just activity going on around
[759.92 - 760.12]  you?
[760.44 - 766.26]  It could be either, both. But I didn't hear him say that the activity was the important part. I heard him say that the people were the important part,
[766.42 - 768.90]  even though there's lots going on, but it was going on with people.
[785.66 - 845.72]  Some people who have a high need for act. So here's the deal. If you hire somebody who has a high need for act, if you really want to hire somebody to get something done, hire somebody who has a high need for activity and put them in charge of something, like typing all your all the stuff that hasn't been typed or sorting putting putting all the stuff into files that haven't, hasn't been filed or, or sorting out different things and, and what, what'll happen is they'll get it done in a week and then they'll wonder what's next. You know, we, we, no, once, once, once at Advanced Neurodynamics we hired a, a, a front desk person who had activities or high, very, very high need. And this was actually the one I told you about who said she didn't have a favorite restaurant because they were all too boring. So we asked her to, like, to... We had this horrendous filing system. And we asked her to refile everything and she had it done in a week. And then she got so bored because there wasn't enough to do that she left us. But all of our stuff was cleaned up. No, she says there's nothing to do around here when i first got here there was lots to do but now there's nothing to do isn't that great so she went on leaving her mark of having organized everything for us yeah isn't this context dependent though everything is because like yeah duh okay thanks for sharing, though. I appreciate it.
[847.70 - 847.88]  No, all metaprograms are context-dependent.
[863.16 - 863.86]  That's why we asked you to take this in a certain context. Okay. Because my other job was mobile ophthalmic photography, in which case it was totally people-oriented, which I love, because of the people. So two different contexts, two different feelings. But it's also systems, isn't it? Yeah. but my enjoyment was the people
[863.86 - 864.64]  is what I'm saying
[864.64 - 864.82]  yeah
[864.82 - 865.34]  yeah okay
[865.34 - 865.64]  right now
[865.64 - 866.40]  I don't hear things
[866.40 - 866.66]  from that
[866.66 - 867.24]  I hear systems
[867.24 - 868.28]  right
[868.28 - 868.64]  okay
[868.64 - 886.22]  now systems isn't it yeah but my enjoyment was the people is what i'm saying yeah yeah okay right now i don't hear things from that i hear systems right okay now if you find somebody by the way who has a high people need don't put them in the back room running the computer or doing data entry because they'll be out front talking to everybody in the office it's true it's true or or or a better idea you know, a people person, don't think they'll
[886.22 - 903.84]  be back there doing it. Or a things person, don't put them at the front desk answering the phones and meeting people. Because they're not going to be interested in that. Okay, chunk size filter. If we were going to do a project together, would you want to know the details first or the big picture first? Big picture. Totally big picture. Do you need the details? No, I really don't. Okay.
[908.06 - 928.96]  If we were going to do a project together, would you need to know that? Big picture first, definitely. Would you need to know the details? Some of them, later. Later. Not right away. Definitely not. Okay. Good. Okay. Ian. The big picture and the details just fall into place. oh that's good so you don't really need to know the details they'll just fall into place they always do
[928.96 - 925.32]  always do Ian? The big picture and the details just fall into place. Oh, that's good.
[925.36 - 926.48]  So you don't really need to know the details.
[926.56 - 927.14]  They'll just fall into place.
[927.18 - 927.30]  Yeah.
[927.64 - 927.86]  Great.
[927.90 - 928.42]  They always do.
[928.46 - 928.96]  They always do.
[929.02 - 929.48]  Always do.
[929.92 - 941.26]  Wow, okay, okay. Anybody details first? Joe, give me yours. Big picture, other people worry about the details. You have to hire the people that worry about the details. Some folks back there like that.
[941.76 - 942.78]  Anybody details first?
[944.00 - 944.84]  Anybody details first?
[946.34 - 947.92]  Okay, let's move on to the next one.
[948.34 - 967.60]  Get your sheet out, if you would would or look at the three coins either one and the question is what's the relationship between these three now this is this is where it gets to be fun what's the relationship between these three coins or these three boxes okay who's ready matthew same they're all the same Oh, Lauren wants to know, are's ready? Matthew. Same. They're all the same.
[969.38 - 969.94]  Lauren wants to know, are you serious?
[970.18 - 971.16]  Yeah.
[974.34 - 974.90]  They've got the same likenesses and the same differences.
[975.94 - 977.96]  They're the same. They're all the same coin and they're arranged differently.
[979.88 - 980.28]  Okay.
[981.18 - 983.20]  Two are the same and one's facing the other way.
[983.42 - 983.92]  One's different.
[984.46 - 1047.10]  So two are the same and one's different. Now, when she says two are the same, is she noticing the hole? Not necessarily. So we may classify her all the way down to sameness and differences equally. We're going to come back now. So how long have you remained on your average job? Probably 18 months. 18 months. Yeah, not real long. I have to keep doing you know different things right so the answer you gave us was so the answer you gave us was sameness and differences equally probably based on because all you're doing is looking for poundage here for for the amount of stuff that comes through the hopper so what you said was essentially uh sameness and differences equally or one one statement that used to really confuse me when people used to say it's the same difference it's actually a different sameness for you it's it's like hey you know it's either different or it's the same right okay let's go back to lauren so lauren how often do you remain on an average job? Well, there are circumstances, like once I moved to Germany.
[1047.60 - 1048.02]  Sure, sure.
[1048.40 - 1062.26]  And then I took a long time off to have my children, and then I was in one for three years, and I just started this one a year ago. So it looks slow, but... So three years. So three years is the longest you've gone. Yeah. Right? And what would we have classified her as?
[1062.98 - 1068.46]  We would have classified her as differences and sameness equally at best
[1068.46 - 1065.10]  because she said there's two and then there's one. And what would we have classified her as? We would have classified her as differences
[1065.10 - 1085.62]  and sameness equally at best because she said there's two and then there's one, which often tells us that she's looking for the differences first. And so we're about two years off on Lauren's job, longevity. Who's next? Okay. I'm kind of like a jack-of-all-trades. I've done everything. Have you? I don't last long or anything. I had to move on.
[1085.70 - 1086.22]  I had to move on.
[1088.06 - 1089.04]  But you have to tell me
[1089.04 - 1089.60]  what's the relationship
[1089.60 - 1085.62]  between these two? Okay. I'm kind of like a jack-of-all-trades. I've done everything. Have you? I don't last long or anything. I had to move on.
[1085.72 - 1086.22]  I had to move on.
[1088.04 - 1090.44]  But you have to tell me what's the relationship between these three boxes.
[1090.44 - 1103.12]  I would say they're pretty similar in every respect, except for, well, you know, they're the same, but I can see an offset, so I don't know. it was a tough question for me actually to see which one it would go under so as you look at
[1103.12 - 1127.04]  the three boxes yes i would say they're um similar. Pretty similar. Do you hear the word pretty similar, though? Yeah, so if they're pretty similar, what other relationships do you see? Well, like I said, when I look at them, I realize it's all the same coin, but there is a difference in the way one is set, but it's just a matter of point of view on the...
[1127.04 - 1130.54]  I read too much into the question at your lunch, man, so...
[1130.54 - 1132.50]  And is that how you answered it when you did your test?
[1140.20 - 1145.10]  That was the question I had to go back to once I finished the test. Okay. And keep evaluating. Okay, so what we want to find out now is why is he at 18 months when he seems to be so high for sameness?
[1145.82 - 1148.18]  And the answer could be that,
[1148.50 - 1165.52]  did you work for companies where they kept changing things on you? No. So there was no reason that you could... No, I just, I don't know, I just, it's just not what I wanted to do, I guess. I don't want to stick with a company. I'd rather do my own thing.
[1165.60 - 1168.82]  I work well with myself, not with a lot of people.
[1169.94 - 1172.60]  Unless I can choose my, let's say, for example, to become a team.
[1172.64 - 1174.42]  If I can choose my team, that's great, but I don't have that choice.
[1174.42 - 1179.60]  So you were out of those companies for a different reason other than,
[1179.76 - 1185.86]  you didn't work well with other people, so you have a high independence factor. I don't think it's...
[1185.86 - 1188.48]  I'd rather, if I had a choice, I'd rather work by myself.
[1188.88 - 1189.88]  And I like to move on.
[1190.44 - 1200.16]  I like dealing with new people. I don't like to stick with the same people for too long. That's a good way of putting it. You like dealing with different people. Yeah, and I don't want to get stuck with the same crowd for a long time. that voice of me on the line,
[1200.34 - 1201.68]  which I'm in a case like that right now
[1201.68 - 1202.56]  where I'm ready to move on
[1202.56 - 1204.72]  because I'm down the people I work with.
[1205.38 - 1207.44]  So notice that as we get more information,
[1207.56 - 1208.76]  what we're hearing is more differences
[1208.76 - 1227.02]  in his preference, in his preference style. There's also an alternative question, which is what's the relationship between what you're doing right now and what you were doing a year ago? And in this case, especially when we get a mismatch between his job longevity
[1227.02 - 1243.58]  and the way he answers a question, we need to go on and gather more information. So let's... Actually, the kind of work I do now, I think this is probably the longest I've ever been in, when it comes to any job, but I really can't wait to get out of it. So, I mean, I... So... It's just... between what you were doing. How long have you been doing this? 18 years?
[1243.94 - 1245.82]  This is going on pretty much
[1245.82 - 1247.46]  for about three years now. Oh, three years?
[1247.60 - 1265.40]  Yeah, three years too long. So before that, what was the relationship, let's say, three to four years ago? Oh, entirely different. There was no similarities at all. I mean, see, what was the relationship?
[1268.86 - 1272.12]  So what you want to do is keep probing for a relationship question and notice if you can find the reason why it's different if it is.
[1272.18 - 1273.08]  So let's talk to Ian.
[1273.64 - 1277.22]  Ian, what is the relationship between these three boxes?
[1278.50 - 1281.58]  There's one different and two of the same.
[1282.10 - 1282.26]  Okay.
[1316.44 - 1316.88]  And what's the relationship between the three quarters? You know, they are different. They are different? Mm-hmm. And what's been the average length of time that you spend on a job? Well, before I started this business, I was doing consulting work, and I guess it may have been just a matter of months.
[1319.52 - 1319.70]  So you were on different jobs.
[1319.96 - 1321.12]  Yes.
[1324.08 - 1324.40]  And you typically would stay in a certain job for months.
[1324.68 - 1346.40]  That's right. And how long have you been doing this one? Seven years. Seven years, right. Okay, good. So what's going on for Ian is he's transitioning, right? So we hear that there's a transition there. And he started off by giving differences first, which means that we would primarily predict his job longevity at three years
[1346.40 - 1347.80]  three years or less
[1347.80 - 1350.16]  since he gave us differences and then exceptions
[1350.16 - 1352.50]  and probably
[1352.50 - 1354.64]  because you're, probably what will
[1354.64 - 1356.74]  keep you doing this job is that there's enough change
[1356.74 - 1358.78]  in it. Is that important to you?
[1358.88 - 1360.74]  Is there enough change? As you define your own job
[1360.74 - 1362.66]  how many times, as you define your own
[1362.66 - 1364.78]  job in your own company, how many times has that
[1364.78 - 1369.44]  changed for you? A lot I'm still going through that. So how, so how many times have
[1369.44 - 1375.24]  you redefined the company? Twice in the last seven years, and I'm going through a major one right
[1375.24 - 1381.76]  now. So you're, so you've redefined the company every? Three years, in fact. Three years? Yeah.
[1382.90 - 1425.94]  Right, good. So one of the things about somebody that works for themselves is that um when it comes to prediction of job longevity you have to be careful because because they can redefine their own company and if they redefine their own company they'll define it in a way that keeps them in that company or if or someone that can redefine their job sufficiently they'll define it that way okay Okay, who else wants to? I was wondering whether it was important that you left the plural of relationships when you asked for what is the relationship as opposed to what are the relationships. So let me ask you a question. What's the relationship between these three boxes? Well, there are two differences and one the same
[1425.94 - 1485.32]  and a and a differences person will actually ask you that question why don't you ask for the relationships rather than the relationship so his answer even though he mentioned sameness we have a tip off where he actually said how many relationships are there so let's let's look at longevity. My prediction is probably 18 months. My first job, I went through a number of different jobs lasting 6 to 12 months. And my last job I've been in for 11 years. And what is the job you're doing now? I'm working as a family doctor. Would you say there's a lot of change in it, though? There will be. Would you say that there was a lot of change in the job or enough differences to keep you... Well, first of all, let me ask you this question. When you change jobs a lot, were you already a doctor? Yes. And the job that you're in right now, is there a lot of change,
[1485.38 - 1487.28]  or is it that you get to see a lot of different people?
[1489.26 - 1491.74]  Is there a reason why you feel that there's enough change for you?
[1492.66 - 1494.16]  That's a difficult question to answer.
[1494.40 - 1497.62]  There's a lot of change being forced upon us.
[1499.56 - 1502.18]  But, I mean, for the last 11 years,
[1502.74 - 1506.70]  has there been a lot of changes that you've been able to do?
[1506.82 - 1508.02]  Like, have you changed your office?
[1508.38 - 1509.84]  Have you changed location of office?
[1510.42 - 1511.80]  Have you changed job description?
[1511.98 - 1514.44]  Have you seen different kinds of patients?
[1514.76 - 1516.52]  Yes, I am changing my job description.
[1517.12 - 1518.38]  Have you changed your office at all,
[1518.42 - 1519.82]  or have you been in the same office for 11 years?
[1520.06 - 1520.66]  Same office.
[1521.20 - 1521.82]  Well, that's a surprise.
[1521.82 - 1549.12]  Did you move the furniture in your office at all? Yes. How often did you move the furniture in your office? Twice. Okay, one of the ways we solved, we had one client that had a manager that was coming up to the end of their stay and was acting that they were about to leave, and we actually had the firm switch the manager's office, just totally switch the office, and that kept him for another five years after we did that. So what I'm guessing is if you've been there 11 years,
[1549.20 - 1545.40]  you've been able to create enough. the manager's office. Just totally switch the office and that kept him for another five years
[1545.40 - 1546.04]  after we did that.
[1546.98 - 1548.16]  So what I'm guessing is
[1548.16 - 1562.88]  if you've been there 11 years, you've been able to create enough change for yourself that you feel comfortable with the amount of change that there is. I would say that's right. When that happens, then we can look for the exception. But I'm honestly surprised that you actually stayed there 11 years, so you must like the amount of change that
[1562.88 - 1564.14]  occurs in your job, would you say?
[1564.32 - 1566.30]  I have been planning to
[1566.30 - 1568.58]  move on
[1568.58 - 1585.36]  in life. how long had you been planning this uh this has been evolving over the past two or three years okay so because you had a plan then you were willing to stay there that's right yeah okay so someone who's got a lot of differences is going to also have a high need for change someone who has a lot of differences is going to also have a high need for change.
[1586.40 - 1587.82]  Someone who has a lot of differences is also going to have a high need for change.
[1591.30 - 1594.66]  This is the end of Tape 21, Side A.
