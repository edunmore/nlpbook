[0.00 - 24.04]  The question is,
[24.24 - 65.32]  what's the first thing that you want to do? Probably the first thing you want to do if you really want to integrate the conscious mind and the unconscious mind is to present some information. Okay, let's look at page 414. There's about 30 things I do when I'm doing a training. I'll often sort of open loops and sort of not close them, as you noticed. Builds an error of expectancy. Let's get on with it, or that sort of thing. We can also structure the state of the students moment to moment using hypnotic language patterns and anchoring these states.
[65.70 - 67.72]  One of the things I wonder if you've noticed
[67.72 - 70.28]  is that you're pretty much anchored to the sound of my voice
[70.28 - 73.64]  and from time to time that I can change the tone
[73.64 - 75.98]  and the tempo and the pitch of my voice
[75.98 - 78.94]  and as I do that you can probably experience
[78.94 - 81.20]  certain shifts in your consciousness
[81.20 - 105.54]  to where it gets easier and easier just to sort of settle down and pay attention to certain internal states and processes. And you're probably even anchored to my posture because when I actually sit a certain way and just sort of settle back, you probably find yourself entering a different state than if I were more forward,
[105.80 - 107.16]  using a little bit different tone of voice,
[107.24 - 108.30]  using a little bit different tempo,
[108.42 - 109.28]  a little bit different pitch,
[109.46 - 111.92]  and moving in just a little bit different speed.
[112.62 - 114.70]  And notice, so notice that from time to time
[114.70 - 116.74]  that we can actually change
[116.74 - 120.30]  and begin to experience moving back and forth
[120.30 - 122.18]  in different, and actually in different states.
[122.46 - 146.88]  And it's just a matter of once the anchors have been set up, once the anchoring is all set. And for this training, the anchoring was all set up, if you want to go back and listen to the tapes, was actually pretty well set up in the first hour and a half to three hours for everyone in the room. And so by this time, the anchoring of the voice tonality, the tempo, and the pitch is pretty well set.
[146.88 - 163.44]  So you're able to access those states, and personally what I do is I use the different levels of trance and different levels of state to allow the students to be able to experience those levels. And when we need this student more in trance, then they're more in trance, and when they're not more in trance, they're not more in trance. They come out of trance, but not yet,
[163.72 - 165.28]  because I want to go through some information,
[165.42 - 167.48]  which will be more fun if you're just relaxed.
[168.00 - 265.58]  So the next thing I do is sequence the content. Content sequencing is very, very important in a training. Each material needs to lead to the next, and that's one of the things that I'm very happy with that we do in our trainings is I think we've got our trainings pretty well sequenced. The training I'm most proud of, of course is the trainer's training, the way it sequences people from ground zero to really full-on trainers. Content chunking is also important, and that really has to do with what logical level you're operating at. If you chunk too big, you're likely to lose people, and if you chunk too small, you're likely to bore them. So a training always sort of treads that fine line between too little and too much information. Personally, I'll sit and look at a room and calibrate the room and notice what they're doing, paying attention to that, and then when I see that they've got enough information, then we'll just go ahead and do the exercise. Do I use anchors during the training at all? Yeah, okay, well, we mentioned that. Have you noticed, by the way, that a lot of the patterns that you learned during this training were demonstrated before you actually did them? I don't know if you've noticed that. Of course, some people will notice that and then they won't want to notice it. Some people would prefer that it wasn't exactly that way, or some people would prefer that it was that way. And actually, a lot of times, you know, they may know inside themselves or they may know outside themselves. Some people may have an experience of that once and know it or twice and know it. Some people will have to see it and they'll know it. Some people will actually have to
[265.58 - 305.88]  have someone tell them and then they would know that that was happening. I don't know. Some people would like to do it alone. Some people need to do it in groups in terms of understanding that. And I don't know if you've noticed that from time to time, probably somewhere between a few hours to as much as a couple or three days that I'll actually demonstrate on a nonverbal level the patterns we're about to teach. And I don't know if you've noticed this, but probably you could notice it if you were going to go back and listen to the tapes, is this leads to number 14, which is a feeling of familiarity.
[325.26 - 326.50]  I don't know how much of the material that you've gotten into has, as you've gotten into it, seemed to be familiar. Have you noticed a certain feeling of familiarity with the material as you got into it? How many people have noticed that? Good. Virtually everyone, yeah. Good. So what that means is that we've done our sequencing correctly. So as you come into new pieces of material. By the way, what did I just do a few minutes ago? Just a moment ago? What did I non-verbally demonstrate?
[328.04 - 345.32]  Metaprograms, right. Just a few moments ago, I non-verbally ran through about seven or eight of the metaprograms on a non-verbal level. I mean, not non-verbally, but I used the patterns without identifying it linguistically. So what I want you to know is that that happens throughout all of the trainings that I do,
[346.02 - 345.32]  where we'll actually be demonstrating on a nonver happens throughout all of the trainings that I do,
[345.84 - 347.42]  where we'll actually be demonstrating
[347.42 - 348.62]  on a nonverbal level
[348.62 - 349.40]  some of the material
[349.40 - 350.24]  that's about to come,
[350.58 - 351.36]  which gives the student
[351.36 - 352.22]  a feeling of familiarity
[352.22 - 352.92]  before that.
[353.86 - 354.66]  That's number six.
[355.38 - 356.44]  Training states, of course.
[356.50 - 357.62]  You've gone through certain states
[357.62 - 358.38]  from time to time.
[358.96 - 359.44]  And of course,
[359.54 - 360.22]  from time to time,
[360.50 - 445.16]  number eight, we actually do give you content. Whoa. We'll come back to the format system. I'm going to talk a little bit about that because I think it's important to present information in a way that it's palatable to the conscious mind also. We also need to look at applications of the material that's been covered. And from time to time, we may restructure the student's model of the world. That usually happens in trainings that I do during the question and answer session, when we're actually doing questions, which is why I like questions. Some people in our field don't like questions. I don't know if you've noticed that, but I love them. And one of the reasons why I like questions is because when the student asks a question, their conscious mind is listening for the answer, which gives me a tremendous opportunity to work with all of the rest of the other of who they are at your unconscious level. So I love questions. And from time to time, we'll work with that. We teach that in the trainer's training. It's called questions are the answer. In addition, we'll want to link everything to the student's internal representation or to their model of the world. That's sort of linking to what you already know, which also give a good feeling of familiarity. We've used temporal language. Have you noticed that we've backtracked and covered most everything that you covered in your practitioner training?
[445.40 - 445.58]  Good.
[446.00 - 464.90]  So during this training, we went back and picked up just about everything that you covered, at least in asking you to recall it, and that's called backtracking. Typically, when I teach, I'll use a KAV sequence, which means we'll start slowly and move up a little more quickly and then a little more quickly. That's one of the things we teach at the trainer training.
[467.08 - 488.26]  Bonding is a process that appeals to the unconscious mind and we deal a little bit with that on our trainer's training tapes. There's some information on there about that. I think it's important to express emotions, too. I think that personally that's something I learn to work with more and more and I think that probably
[488.26 - 492.24]  the more emotion we can express, the better off we are as human beings.
[492.24 - 496.72]  So I think that's also something that's good for a trainer to do.
[496.72 - 500.56]  Utilization is something you probably want to do too as you find old concepts fall away.
[500.56 - 502.36]  Certain things are off the wall.
[502.36 - 506.74]  That's perfect.
[506.74 - 525.00]  Utilization is extremely important to do during a training. And for those of you on tape, one of our wall charts just fell off the wall over there and to the right, stage right end. So what I did was simply utilize it. Fractionation. Fractionation means taking the student in and out of trance.
[525.00 - 647.66]  Have you been in and out of trance during? Yeah, we won't have to talk about that. Reframing, of course. We do parts, metaphors. Angular postures. We talk a little bit about that in the trainer's training. Angular postures are more interesting than straight-on postures, for some reason. So, that's also used. Demonstrating patterns, overtly. Expanded Awareness or Hakalao. We've spent a lot of time on that. We've used humor, stacked presuppositions, and internal representations. And finally, transformation. Because I think if we can transform ourselves during a training, that's the most important thing we can do. Because I figured I could teach. I told you this the first day, or I could transform people, so I decided to. And so that's what it's about for me. Obviously, we couldn't go over this in a short presentation skills training, but I wanted to give you just a taste. The other thing I want to assure you is, should you choose to take our trainer's training, or if you can't attend it, you can always listen to it on tape, that all of these 30 things will be installed in you and for you, and you'll find, without even having to think about it, interestingly enough, you'll find that you actually leave the trainer's training and you're using them. So to begin with, I figure that, and I don't know if you figured this out, but, I mean, personally, 30 things is more than you can do consciously. Did you know that? You know the old 7 plus or minus 2, right? Well, that's like 7 plus or minus 7 plus or minus 7 plus or minus 7 plus or minus. I didn't know. 4 times 7 is 28 plus or minus 2. Makes 30. That's a lot of things to do. That's like 4 times our regular conscious state. And so the truth is that this is not something you're going to do consciously, making a presentation, doing really well at it. It's not something you're going to do consciously. It's going to be something you're going to do unconsciously.
[648.24 - 662.14]  So I want to point that out. And the exercises we're going to do today, which are a lot of fun, are mostly designed to have you have an unconscious experience of the process of getting up in front of folks. And they'll be the first, not the first, but they'll be some of the exercises we do,
[662.50 - 664.36]  sort of a sprinkling of different exercises.
[664.84 - 667.80]  What I'd like you to do as you're sitting here,
[668.00 - 689.58]  because I know that there's something you'd like to talk about in your life. I know there's something that you'd like to talk about in your life, and I know there's something you do talk about in your life, whether it's like the guy I met out here who's a fisherman. He talks about fishing. and you probably got something in your life you like to talk about that you don't even have to think about for some folks it's like me
[689.58 - 686.08]  it could be Like the guy I met out here who's a fisherman, he talks about fishing. And you've probably got something in your life you'd like to talk about
[686.08 - 704.38]  that you don't even have to think about. For some folks, like me, it could be computers or little handheld, crazy little electronic devices or even NLP. But why don't you, just for the fun of it, as we're about to go into our next segment, why don't you pick something that you can talk about without thinking about it and think about it for just a moment.
[704.50 - 705.74]  And we're not going to talk about it long,
[705.80 - 706.52]  just two or three minutes,
[706.68 - 707.34]  four or five minutes
[707.34 - 725.24]  when we do our little presentation. So let's look at page 415. It's important, even though we're using, what are we using here? Hypnotic techniques. But even though we're using hypnotic techniques, you do have to give the conscious
[725.24 - 728.88]  mind some content. There are some folks in our field who don't give the conscious mind
[728.88 - 735.62]  content. And, bless their hearts, some people walk out of those trainings and go, huh, what
[735.62 - 740.16]  did I learn? Great state, great time, but not sure that they got anything consciously.
[740.80 - 745.44]  And so personally, in terms of where I sit on the continuum of all unconscious or all
[745.44 - 749.94]  conscious, I prefer to be somewhere in the middle, to where I really feel like I'm giving
[749.94 - 826.66]  Thank you for watching. unconsciously. And so personally, in terms of where I sit on the continuum of all unconscious or all conscious, I prefer to be somewhere in the middle, to where I really feel like I'm giving the unconscious mind some really good experience and good states, and to where I also feel like the conscious mind is getting sufficient information to be able to have something to deal with or to chew on. So this particular training sequence I kind of like, and we spend a little bit of time in the trainer's training discovering how to utilize that in the process of creating or sequencing your trainings. But let's talk a little bit about what it is. The first thing that we're going to suggest is that in presenting any kind of information at all, that you want to give the students some information and explain something about what it is you're talking about. Especially if you're teaching deductively, the students will need a fair amount of what? For example, anchoring is a process of stimulus response. It came from a guy named, originally from Ivan Pavlov, who developed behavioral psychology and essentially what it says is when a stimulus is presented to a person and they go into an intense state that we can actually anchor that state and be able to recall it. That's a quick what on anchoring, isn't it? Then the next thing you want to do is tell the person why. Or you could tell them why first. But, for example, have you ever wished that you could be in charge of your own state?
[826.76 - 830.60]  Have you ever been in a negative state and wished you could be in a positive state more quickly?
[830.74 - 835.76]  Have you ever wanted to collapse states or get rid of states that you didn't like easily?
[836.12 - 839.42]  Or have you ever wished that sometimes when you got into a certain state
[839.42 - 842.50]  that you could get out of it, like procrastination, and move into a state of motivation?
[843.38 - 885.00]  How would you like to be in charge of your own state? That's a real quick why for a person. That's a real quick why. Then, the next thing to do is to do a how. And the how of anchoring is you watch the person, notice the state change. When you see the state change come up, you apply the anchor. When you see the state get to the peak, you let go of the anchor. And oftentimes you'd have the students do an exercise. And then when they come back, you have them discuss what if. And three questions I like to ask, which you've heard me ask probably from time to time, is what do you need to tell me? What questions do you have? What did you discover from this exercise? I'll use one or all of those oftentimes after an exercise.
[926.38 - 987.00]  And then finally, I think it's important to, the entire time, number four, is to be teaching the unconscious mind. So this sequence of what or why first, and then what, and then how, and then what if, is not something that I developed personally. It's not something I can take credit for. It was developed by Bernice McCarthy, and if you look at page 416, there is just a little diagram of the format system. The format system, and this is a real simplified diagram, there's a lot of material in the format system by Bernice McCarthy. Bernard Kolb developed the Kolb Learning Style Inventory, which is a paper and pencil instrument. There are a number of books on the format system. It's nice to read and what it essentially says is that people learn in four different ways. Some people learn and can only learn once they know why. How many people here need to know why before they can learn something? Anybody? Right. And then some people like to have a lot of information about it. And some people can only learn once they have a ton of information. How many people like all, a lot of information? Tons of information about a material or something like that you're learning? Right. And then the next thing, some people need to know how to do it. Many people are interested, a lot of people are interested in how to do it. I'm interested in what it's about. I'm interested in the content or the information about it. All they want to know is how do I do anchoring? Don't give me the theory. Don't tell me anything about it. Just teach me how to do it. How many people like to know how. Anybody here? Right. And then finally, the what if person. And the what
[987.00 - 986.64]  if person likes to discover and find out all. How many people like to know how? Anybody here? Right. And then finally, the what-if person.
[986.72 - 988.36]  And the what-if person likes to discover
[988.36 - 1004.66]  and find out all the possibilities that one could do with anchoring. What could you do with anchoring? What would happen if this happened? What happens if this happened? How many people here are sort of what-if people? Right. Now, you may have raised your hand for more than one. you may have felt that you're more than one
[1004.66 - 1008.50]  but notice what is emphasized in our school system
[1008.50 - 1105.02]  in the United States today, which is essentially what. And in some cases where there's a laboratory situation, how. But notice that a lot of people in this room were also why and what if people. And so one of the things we recommend during a particular training, and of course in the early days once they discovered the format system, the educators thought, well let's just get all the why people in one room and we'll teach them why. And get all the what people in one room and we'll teach them what. And all the how people in one room and we'll teach them how. But the fact is that that doesn't work for people either necessarily because it's best for people to learn all the other things too. So in essence, what they discovered was if you actually sequence your information in why, what, how, and what if, that sequencing it that way made it very palatable to the most number of people. Alternatively, you could do what, and then why, and then how and what if. And alternatively, that would be also appropriate. Depends on your intention and actually the process of how you're teaching that. So again, the thing to remember essentially is that when you're teaching, and we're looking at slide number 112 now, when you're teaching, you can begin with a why or a what in quadrant number one or two. The why person needs reasons and relevance. Oftentimes discussion works. The what person needs more information. And if you sequence it then to the how person, you need to let the person try it out and do it, and the what if person will teach themselves and others and also will actually look for different ways to use this
[1105.02 - 1185.24]  and different possibilities and different consequences of the use of whatever it is you're teaching. That's just a real brief summary of the format system, but if you ever have to make another presentation in your life, my guess is if you think through the material that you're about to present and think about it in terms of why, what, how, and what if, you'll probably end up presenting the information to the people that listen to your training a lot more logically and a lot more palatably for the conscious mind. And see, one of the things I think is, a lot of times when people say, oh, that person used too much hypnosis, or perhaps the students were not, or some students will walk away from the training getting a vague feeling of not having any content, this totally solves that problem because if you give the conscious mind why, what, how, what, if, then you can use any amount of hypnotic patterning and any amount of hypnotic language patterning, any amount of deep trance work with the students, and their conscious mind will still be satisfied. So try that the next time you have to talk about something. Now, as you're thinking, and by the way, however you get up and speak with your little group in just a moment is fine, but as you're thinking, what I'd like to do is to just have you sort of think about what it is you could
[1185.24 - 1189.08]  present. It doesn't have to be NLP, by the way. It could be something you know well.
[1203.16 - 1405.36]  Some of you may know how to drive a car well. Some of you may know how to play golf. Some of you may know. But it's something you know really well, something you may have found yourself teaching other people from time to time or something you've explained before. Think about that for just a bit, and we're going to do actually two exercises before that, which are designed to assist your conscious mind in getting out of the way. Because the truth is, if you're really going to do more than, how many things? Well, five things, maybe, in front of a room. And when you stand in front of a room and look at the audience, that's at least two. The truth is, or maybe three, and for some folks it's ten, because they want to scratch but don't. That's at least two, want to scratch but don't. So now we've got four out of the way and we're working on the fifth. So the truth is, if you're even going to get up in front of people, the first thing to do is to trust your unconscious mind. Now, what's interesting about this process is, and I don't mean it's beside the point. He said pointing to himself. What's interesting, what's interesting about the process that we're about to learn is that it just follows on top of what we did yesterday. Because yesterday we did a process where you went into peripheral vision. Yesterday we did a process where you went into peripheral vision. Today, the very first thing we're going to do in learning how to get up in front of people and make a presentation is we're actually going to learn how to stand in front of people and be in peripheral vision. Now, in case you're wondering, and I know you were wondering, well, wondering actually is good because that means that you're beginning to make new connections, new integrations, learn new things, have new insights. I mean, more or some new insights, which at the unconscious level should make certain connections that allow you to feel comfortable in front of the room. You remember the exercise we did yesterday, right? Remember the exercise we did yesterday about foveal, and then going into peripheral vision, hakala, and then thinking of a problem state, and so forth. Well, this sort of follows right along from that, because one of the things that I do is I ask every trainer that I train, and as you guys know, I'm sure, this year when we do the trainer's training will be our 12th annual trainer training. We train at this point anywhere from 80, upwards of 80 people per year. I would say we've been doing that for the last 12 years although the trainings have gotten consistently bigger over the years. But let's say we've trained six or seven hundred people so far how to be most exquisite trainers and the very first thing I ask a trainer to do the very, very first thing when I'm asking someone to get up in front of a room is I ask them to go into peripheral vision I ask them to go into peripheral vision and I ask them to do it for a number of reasons now think about this for just a minute would... Oh, I've got to ask this first question
[1405.36 - 1406.80]  because I want to do some statistics
[1406.80 - 1407.74]  because this is kind of fun.
[1424.96 - 1425.96]  And the folks on the tapes, I'm sure, want to know because they're probably feeling the way they feel listening to the tapes. And I'd like them to know how you feel. So how many people here do not feel comfortable getting up in front of or speaking in front of a group? Anybody? Did you say 30 or 40 percent? Forty.
[1425.96 - 1426.96]  Forty.
[1426.96 - 1427.96]  Okay.
[1427.96 - 1505.78]  And how many people have never gotten up and spoken in front of a group. Anybody? Did you say 30 or 40%? 40. Okay. And how many people have never gotten up and spoken in front of a group? Okay, so everyone has, but they all know that they don't feel comfortable. Great. Okay, so what we're going to do, the first thing we're going to do is to actually get up and notice that we can experience a state of expanded awareness while we're actually standing in front of some people. And I'm going to put on some music for this purpose, which will allow us to sort of get our conscious mind out of the way. And what we'll ask you to do is to just sort of come up in front of the room and go into a state of peripheral vision. you certainly have it anchored in, so if it was ever, if you ever wanted to fire that anchor, or if you're going to go into and remember how it was, you can certainly call up that state and sort of be in that state at will. I'll sort of talk you into it as you do. And we're going to ask you as you are up here, I'll tell you what we're going to do in advance. We're actually, if this is you, and I were looking down on the top of your head, and we're looking at slide number 109 now, I'm going to ask you to extend your awareness out, if this is you sort of on the stage here, I'm going to ask you to extend your awareness out to the front of the room. Slide number 109.
[1505.78 - 1524.46]  So that it goes all the way, your awareness goes all the way out to the extent of the dashed lines on both the right and the left of our little person. When your awareness is expanded out like that, then I want you to take your awareness and expand it out to the farthest corners of the room. So imagine going all the way to the slide, the top of the slide. As you stand in the room, expand your awareness
[1524.46 - 1526.24]  all the way out to the farthest corner of the room
[1526.24 - 1528.70]  so that your awareness is, if you look at the slide,
[1528.78 - 1527.66]  at the top left and the top of the slide. As you stand in the room, expand your awareness all the way out to the farthest corner of the room so that your awareness is,
[1527.94 - 1530.34]  if you look at the slide, at the top left and top right of the slide,
[1530.42 - 1540.26]  which is a diagram of the room, right? You're standing on the stage, looking out into the audience. Expand your awareness out so that it's in both corners of the room in front of you. then I'm going to ask you to pull
[1540.26 - 1541.26]  and I'll talk you through this
[1541.26 - 1542.84]  I'm going to ask you to pull your awareness
[1542.84 - 1546.32]  down the sides of the room
[1546.32 - 1606.32]  holding your awareness out in the two corners of the room to pull your awareness down the sides of the room and all the way around so that it's 180 degrees around beside you, so that your awareness will then be extended not only in the front corner, the front left and right corner, but down the side walls, and then you're going to pull it all the way around so that it's all the way in front of you and all the way around 180 degrees to your right and left. And then I'm going to ask you to project your awareness into the back right corner of the room and the back left corner of the room so that ultimately your awareness now becomes 360 degrees all the way around you. And I want you to notice what happens, and then what I'm going to ask you to do is to get in touch with the other people in the room who you're looking at, and notice that you actually become more connected with them than you ever have before. That's the process we're about to do. So this is a process of awareness. And if you're
[1606.32 - 1611.64]  listening on the tapes, what we're going to do is we're going to, when we're all done with the
[1611.64 - 1618.38]  first set of people, we're simply going to fade out the music and the tape will stop. But those
[1618.38 - 1622.62]  of us here in the room will go on and we'll do each group of people until everyone is done.
