[0.00 - 3.04]  Let's get specific.
[29.50 - 29.58]  Page 4-7. The key elements in modeling, physiology. First key in physiology is breathing, by the way. And then get the posture. Once you've got the breathing correct, then you've got the posture correct, then everything else sort of flows from that. In terms of the filter patterns, what do we need to know? We need to know some things. We need to know the metaprograms. That's what MP stands for in here. You need to know what the client's metaprograms are,
[25.32 - 25.36]  which include... In terms of the filter patterns, what do we need to know? We need to know some things. We need to know the metaprograms.
[26.92 - 27.86]  That's what MP stands for in here.
[41.30 - 42.34]  We need to know what the client's metaprograms are, which includes the Myers-Briggs, which includes the four basic metaprograms, which are the Myers-Briggs. MMs in this case means metamodel patterns. One of the other things about filters is you want to find out the metamodel patterns
[42.34 - 43.50]  that the person uses
[43.50 - 45.78]  or which they represent
[45.78 - 46.76]  with their speech.
[48.28 - 45.90]  In the U.S. Army Recruiters is you want to find out the meta-model patterns that the person uses or which they represent
[45.90 - 125.34]  with their speech. In the U.S. Army Recruiters Project, they found some very, very interesting linguistic patterns. Very, very interesting linguistic patterns. If you actually go and model some unique salespeople, you'll probably find some linguistic patterns which are very, very unique. So metamodel, so model the languaging pattern. And values, values are very important. All of these together provide a key to how the person filters information and in its most basic sense they answer the question why. This area was often neglected, but it provides the desire, and you need to find out with regards to the filter patterns, what are the enabling beliefs and values and metamodel patterns, and what are the disenabling beliefs, values, and metamodel patterns. And then finally, the third thing you'll need to do is elicit the strategies that the person uses. Now, the other thing about modeling is that modeling is also about chunking. It seems to me if I was going to go model a salesperson, for example, and we discovered this when we were, and fortunately, I already had some information about selling. Oh, I need to say this.
[125.40 - 126.02]  Yeah, I need to say this.
[126.24 - 128.14]  Before you actually go and do a modeling project
[128.14 - 131.42]  of modeling someone or some behavior,
[132.16 - 134.26]  probably you ought to have gathered
[134.26 - 137.94]  a fair amount of information about that behavior
[137.94 - 138.76]  or how to do it.
[139.90 - 142.40]  For example, in the process of creating the HUNA trainings
[142.40 - 143.10]  that we've created,
[143.22 - 206.34]  I have read over 360 books on the subject, not just of HUNA, but also related fields. So, my sense is that you ought to have a reasonably sufficient database in your mind so that when someone gives you a pattern or says, this is what I do, you can recognize it. For example, if you were going to model a surgeon, how a good surgeon did something, you probably would need to know something about surgery. Do you know what I mean? And I don't just mean a couple of weeks' worth of information, right? So in when you're going to do modeling, you probably ought to have as much information as you can about it. And the other thing is you need to chunk it correctly, which is, and this comes to me when we talk about strategies, the third element. So, think about this for just a minute. If you were going to go model a salesperson, what would you model? Would you model all selling? The answer is no. Because if you modeled all selling,
[206.44 - 406.58]  what you would get is, because what does a salesperson do? A salesperson doesn't just sell. The salesperson does lots of different things. What's the first thing a salesperson does? Those of you that have been in sales. What's the first thing a salesperson does when they go out to sell? Prospecting. Prospecting. The first job that a salesperson does is prospecting, and I will tell you that that has quite a bit of different strategies, physiology, well, not necessarily physiology, but especially strategies and filter patterns, than does the second thing they do, which is cold calling. And cold calling, by the way, for those of you who've done selling, is often different from prospecting, right? Then the third thing is what? In addition to cold calling, and it may have a different pattern, is making an appointment. Making an appointment, then what? Making an appointment, then seeing the person in person. Presentation. Making a presentation. Closing may have an actual, which is asking for the order, may have another process. How many have we got now? Five. And what happens then? Then service or reassurance afterwards. And service and reassurance could have two different sorts of ways of doing that. So in the process of selling, just off the top of my head here, there are at least seven or so different things that a person does. When we modeled this client that we worked for on the island of Oahu in Honolulu, there was one other thing, which was letter writing. We had a whole different strategy for letter writing because he did letter writing and we needed to duplicate his thinking in that too. So when you chunk it correctly, you're going to end up with a bunch of different behaviors which may look like they're all part of the process, but you need to get to the level where you're able then to separate out the behaviors. And during that, you're going to have to find out the strategies and any other internal representations that go on. So you want to find out not only the strategies, but also the submodalities, I think would be another way to say it. And also, there could be some other parts of the process which don't fall under strategies, but just fall under what kind of, like, do they hold a visual picture in their mind. For example, one of the things that comes to mind is when a client is learning how to play tennis, the most valuable thing that you can tell them when they serve is to, just before they throw up the ball, is to have a picture in their mind of the ball going over the court, going over to the correct court on the other side of the net, and to have that be associated. That's the most valuable thing that you can actually tell a client, or one of the more valuable things you can tell a client when you're coaching them in terms of how do you learn how to play tennis. Actually, what they found, and CyberVision has done a lot of work on this, if you want to know about sports coaching, CyberVision has done a lot of different tape sets on that. And the question is, like, what does a person do in their mind, or what does one do in one's mind before the process of doing whatever you do? Okay, so that's the strategies. It includes everything that goes on in the mind and also any of the other kinesthetic things that the person does, including tactile, proprioceptive information, tactile or feeling information or proprioceptive information about that.
[408.32 - 412.26]  All right, so that's, those are the key elements.
[412.40 - 413.06]  Some other points.
[414.20 - 415.68]  Modeling is separating what's essential
[415.68 - 416.78]  from what's idiosyncratic.
[418.76 - 425.98]  So a golf player may fix his hat every time before he tees off.
[426.04 - 426.68]  He may go like this.
[427.30 - 444.02]  Is that essential or idiosyncratic? Probably idiosyncratic, but you're going to have to find out because probably you ought to write it down if you're doing a modeling project on a golfer and do it and then don't do it and see if that works. And that's how you do, that's how you separate out idiosyncratic behavior. First of all, you do it,
[444.60 - 445.74]  see if you can produce the results,
[445.80 - 447.72]  and then drop it and see if you can still produce the results.
[448.94 - 487.74]  That's what we had to do in the process of modeling HUNA. HUNA has a lot of, shall we say, mystique around it or certain sorts of ways of doing it, and some of those were idiosyncratic and not necessary. So we didn't teach them in our Huna intensives. And some of them were vital and allow for the person to transform or change themselves. And so we had to do that. And the next thing is feedback. Like, where does the person get feedback from? What, where's the feed, what are the, what are, what are the feedback mechanisms and how do they, how do they make, um, how How do they make adjustments when they do it?
[488.96 - 491.54]  Okay, so there's two ways of doing modeling.
[492.30 - 493.34]  The first is imitation,
[493.54 - 495.68]  and the other is a more cognitive approach
[495.68 - 497.56]  where you do it specifically.
[498.24 - 501.70]  Imitation is just find out what the model is, do it,
[502.02 - 504.28]  and then model yourself to see how you did it.
[504.28 - 686.84]  For some folks, that's a little schizophrenic. People say to me all the time, Ted, you're so great at producing hypnotic language patterns, how do you do that? And I have no idea. In fact, when I try to think about that, it gets very strange. Even if somebody says, well, how do you produce it mathematically? I have no idea. No idea. And so, far be it for me to model myself, but if you can, then that's... I noticed in terms of, like, when I was doing rollerblading and assisting some folks in learning how to do rollerblading, that it was possible to do, is to model myself and do it. But in the imitation way, if you model yourself and you see how you do it, then you're going to be able to create a training out of that. And what's essential, as I mentioned earlier, is to separate that which is idiosyncratic, the difference that makes a difference, and then what you do is you consciously start dropping pieces until you find out what's essential. If the behavior disappears, then you've dropped an essential piece. Right? Now the more cognitive approach, which essentially is, I have to admit I've only done this a few times. I can point to more modeling that I've done more of the imitation process. The first thing to do is analyze, seriously analyze the behavior and do its component parts, get the physiology, the strategies, the why, the motivation, and then do contrastive analysis. So contrastive analysis is to, again, two things that are alike, what produces the difference. It's like what we do in submodalities, but it's with the whole package of physiology strategies and the patterns. And then the next part is, after contrastive analysis, is sensitivity analysis. So the only way I can tell you that is kind of like if there's a certain level of brightness, if you turn it down just a little bit less, the brightness isn't enough. You turn it back up, it's enough. But that could be in terms of the strength of the beliefs or the level of the values in the hierarchy. You may have to have a certain value at a certain level for a person to perform a certain way. That's especially true in things like selling and other things that need a fair amount of motivation. And then strategies, number seven is strategies. It's, it's easy to do imitation modeling. It's a little tougher to do cognitive modeling in terms of strategies. When they were doing the pistol shooting modeling, they, they actually had to stand in front of the shooters and ask them what they were doing while they elicited the strategies. Of course, the guns weren't loaded at that time. But a lot of the guys in the Army project got a little grumpy with the modelers because they, like for example, the marksman might move his eyes upward and to the right as you look
[686.84 - 693.24]  at him, indicating that he was accessing visual recall, and the strategy
[693.24 - 700.00]  elicitator would say, what are you doing? And the marksman would say, nothing.
[700.00 - 703.50]  And he would say, well, are you making a picture in your head? No. Don't bother me,
[703.50 - 806.24]  I'm about to shoot. So they'd watch him again and he'd go up to visual recall. Say, what are you doing? Are you making a picture in your head? No. Well, just sort of slow it down again and let's see. Are you making a picture in your head? Well, maybe I am. So the U.S. Army pistol shooting project was one of the more successful ones, actually. They were able to isolate the differences between a marksman and a regular old person. And they actually cut down the training from four days to one day and saved the U.S. Army 75% of the price of the ammunition that they used to use in training, and increase the qualification level from 70%, virtually, to 100%. So the Army was kind of pleased with that, especially in the cutting down of the number of days of training. But it takes a lot of patient working with the person if you're going to do the cognitive approach and really do it. And then again, you have to install it in yourself. You still have to install it in yourself. And then you have to make sure you can get the same results that the experts can get, which I'm back to the same thing, which is it's easier to model something that you know something about. So if you're going to do modeling, like for example in the U.S. Army pistol shooting, there were three people on the modeling team, some of whom brag about it and some of whom you don't hear about. And the three people were Wyatt Woodsmall and Richard Vandler and Anthony Robbins. And Tony had never shot a gun before, so it was kind of hard to install it in himself. But as you may or may not know,
[806.96 - 809.46]  Richard and Wyatt had a fair amount of experience with guns.
[814.26 - 817.22]  So they were ready, willing, and able
[817.22 - 819.88]  to be able to take on the project.
[821.16 - 823.26]  So, I mean, I think that if you're going to model something,
[823.32 - 824.10]  you need to know enough about it.
[824.10 - 885.32]  If you're going to do selling, you probably ought to read some books on selling or have some experience in selling, if you're going to model that. But model something that you've spent enough time to know about it, and then when you install it in yourself, you'll have sort of an easy go of it. I had never skied until two seasons ago. Oh, I skied when I was 12, but we had those stupid wire things that went around the back of your boots and it was cold and the skis were 17 feet tall because I was 12. Snow skiing, yeah. Yeah, and so I went skiing two seasons ago and actually learned how to ski, and a lot of that was paying really close attention to the physiology, and I felt really good by the end of the fourth day. I did a, what do you call that? Not a black diamond? No, what are you, nuts?
[886.50 - 887.64]  I like to live.
[888.02 - 888.70]  I did a,
[889.96 - 891.08]  at the end of the fourth day,
[891.14 - 892.28]  I did a basic slope,
[892.42 - 893.08]  and by the end of the,
[893.20 - 894.44]  by the end of, I think,
[894.82 - 895.26]  that was good.
[895.32 - 896.72]  I had not skied since I was 12.
[897.82 - 898.88]  And a really tough,
[899.02 - 900.06]  a little tough basic slope,
[900.12 - 901.10]  and by the end of the
[901.10 - 986.30]  second, fourth day, I think it was, I did an intermediate, which I kind of liked. And so for me, without any, I think, background in skiing, that was kind of a, I felt that was kind of a win for me. I don't know how fast people learn. So when you install it in your set, when you're modeling, then you have to install it in yourself and see if you can produce the results. Just see if you can install it in yourself and do it. Mitch, you have a burning, I'm sure. Yes, thank you. Question. When you're modeling excellence, and that excellence happens to be more than one person, invariably, do those two people that share excellence, are they using the same? No? Not necessarily, no. Now, What they found when they modeled the U.S. Army pistol shooting was that there were approximately 54 things that people had in common. And when they isolated all 54 of those things and taught them to new recruits, they increased the qualification virtually to 100 percent. You want to know what some of them are? Sure. One of them was that the marksman had an absolute faith and belief in that the sights of the gun were absolutely correct. And the person who didn't succeed at shooting often had a belief that the sight of the gun was off. So the first thing that the teacher would do is he or she would take a gun
[986.30 - 987.50]  and screw it into a clamp
[987.50 - 989.58]  and they'd shoot it at a target
[989.58 - 991.48]  and prove that the sights were totally right on
[991.48 - 995.22]  to the group
[995.22 - 999.48]  so that's a belief isn't it
[999.48 - 1001.48]  it's an empowering belief or a disempowering belief
[1001.48 - 1002.24]  that was one of the things
[1002.24 - 1004.66]  the other thing was that they found that the really excellent marksman
[1004.66 - 1005.72]  ran through a list
[1005.72 - 1009.72]  of things in their mind as they shot
[1009.72 - 1008.96]  Thank you. an empowering belief or a disempowering belief. That was one of the things. The other thing was that they found that the really excellent marksmen ran through a list of things in their mind
[1008.96 - 1021.98]  as they shot, as they were shooting. So they'd have a list. They'd be talking to themselves as they put the gun in the hand and how they held it out. This was pistol shooting, right? So they had a whole list that they ran through in their mind. and of course there was some stuff
[1021.98 - 1022.60]  about physiology
[1022.60 - 1025.54]  but it wasn't necessarily the same
[1025.54 - 1027.86]  between them but the things that weren't the same
[1027.86 - 1026.24]  they were able to find out which were necessary And, of course, there was some stuff about physiology. But it wasn't necessarily the same between them,
[1026.38 - 1027.86]  but the things that weren't the same,
[1028.00 - 1029.62]  they were able to find out which were necessary,
[1030.24 - 1032.00]  which were idiosyncratic by installing it in themselves
[1032.00 - 1035.20]  and then taking them away and then being able to do it.
[1036.68 - 1039.56]  And then, of course, number nine is you have to design universal training,
[1039.70 - 1041.52]  which they did, and then they trained trainers,
[1041.52 - 1127.48]  and the U.S. Army was able to replicate the success of the modeling project. Not all modeling projects succeeded. The Stinger missile project did not succeed. The Morse code modeling project was a semi-success. This was all U.S. Army stuff. But I think for me, and we're talking in this case about a modeling project where you're actually hired to do it. Personally, I've been real successful at being able to talk to people and pull out models, and it depends on how much time you have and how much you're willing to focus on it in order to create a model that works. There's four things you can do with a model. With the output of modeling, you can set up a training on how to do something more effectively, or simply set up a training. You can set up selection criteria. One of the things we did when we used to do business consulting was we found out how to use metaprograms to do selection for people. One of the interesting things about training is, especially in business or actually in most any situation, is that selection will beat training almost every time. So if you select the people appropriately, then the training will produce the best results. If you're selecting people that aren't particularly suited for a given job, like a salesperson, a salesperson probably ought to be an extrovert.
[1128.26 - 1132.48]  We're going to talk about this during the Myers-Briggs,
[1132.54 - 1134.68]  but a salesperson probably ought to be an extrovert
[1134.68 - 1137.08]  or capable of acting like one.
[1138.26 - 1142.48]  Probably ought to be, depending on who he or she is dealing with,
[1142.54 - 1144.70]  probably ought to be a censor rather than an intuitor
[1144.70 - 1266.26]  or at least able to be flexible enough to chunk down to get specific enough. Probably, it doesn't matter whether the salesperson is a thinker or a feeler, but probably ought to be at least able to go into the feeling side sufficiently, and definitely needs to be a judger rather than a perceiver, so that the salesperson has a pretty high need for closure or needs to be able to learn how to do that. That's just an example. So the salesperson probably ought to be an E, S, T or an F, doesn't matter, J for judger. And at least that's in terms of selection. We've, over Over the years, Myers-Briggs has found that those people become the most effective salespeople. Interestingly enough, a salesperson who is a really solid ESFJ doesn't make a really good manager. The best managers areES while the in the United States the people who end up being managers are mostly estj and the sales and often sales managers are es if they're good salespeople are esfj so the transition from sales manager, or from salesperson to manager, or from sales manager to general manager often doesn't happen because the person isn't flexible enough to learn that. And that's all about selection criteria. So you could take someone who is a feeler and train them forever, and unless they were able to change from thinking to feeling on the feeling side, they probably would not be as effective. The other thing that you can do with modeling is you can model the man-machine interface. That's like how do people use computers, et cetera. How do people use equipment or machines? And you can model the man-man or the person-person interface. Okay, so that's our quick tour de force of modeling. And I want to talk a little bit about training design
[1266.26 - 1269.40]  once you've got the modeling done.
[1270.18 - 1273.36]  And we spend a little bit more time on this
[1273.36 - 1274.02]  at Trainer's Training.
[1274.38 - 1276.22]  But again, today is about sort of
[1276.22 - 1277.86]  how do you take this stuff out
[1277.86 - 1278.72]  and share it with the world.
[1278.92 - 1280.86]  I don't know if any of you are interested in that,
[1280.98 - 1282.80]  but my point of view is that
[1282.80 - 1284.58]  one of the most important things we can do
[1284.58 - 1308.94]  is to get this information out from us as individuals, knowing it, to the rest of the planet. And I think that NLP and timeline therapy and hypnosis has the real possibility of, for the first time, transforming business. That's what got me interested in NLP in the first place was in the business arena. Uh, it has a real possibility of transforming, um, education
[1308.94 - 1317.84]  and it has a, uh, has a real, has a real possibility of, um, transforming, uh, therapy.
[1319.14 - 1465.86]  So each of those, um, each of those areas is, to me, is exciting to see how we can transform that. That's why I do what I do. So training is what we take the output of modeling and make it into. And there are some things. First of all, chunking, we talked about this earlier. If you chunk too big, it's possible that the people themselves might get lost. If you chunk too small, people will get bored. The second thing is you want to sequence the patterns. We're looking at wall chart 115 and page 49, by the way. You want to sequence the teaching in the same order the expert does it. Beliefs and values. You need to find out what the supporting beliefs and values are that they have. You also will need to remove the beliefs that I mentioned with the pistol shooting training one of the disenabling beliefs was that the sights were off. You want to install supporting beliefs and you can use hypnosis or submodality shifts to do that. Positive language. This is a very important part of training, at least in our little branch of neuro-linguistic programming. I don't know if you know how careful we are about making sure that the internal representations are used, the positive internal representations are used during this training. One of the things I want to suggest is that you really shouldn't use the word do not. So don't use do not, or do not use do not. One of the things I want to suggest is that you probably ought to be totally positive and supportive about what the student can do. And if you want studies to the effect that that changes things, remember the kids that we talked about earlier, told the teacher these kids are helplessly retarded, you'll have to, the special ed teacher's not available, they all got C's and D's, same kids, special ed teacher's not available, they're brilliant, they all got A's and B's. So the children perform based on what the teacher thought they would do. That's not an anomaly, that has been, those kinds of studies have been repeated. And so for me, I need to sit here and be totally positive about what a student can do in my mind, that everyone can learn this easily and everyone will be able to do this when they leave here. And use the positive embedded commands about that. The thing is, here's the deal.
[1466.22 - 1469.22]  Negative embedded commands create a need for permission
[1469.22 - 1473.10]  to succeed.
[1473.10 - 1477.92]  So if you use positive teaching methods,
[1478.00 - 1479.28]  what will happen is the students will,
[1479.76 - 1585.98]  they will believe you, and they will actually succeed. Feedback is very critical. It's the most critical component of all. There are two types of feedback, immediate feedback and delayed feedback. To train the unconscious mind, the feedback needs to be immediate. Five minutes is a rule of thumb that we use in our trainings. You need to have feedback within five minutes. The conscious mind can handle delayed feedback well, but the unconscious mind needs immediate feedback. Interestingly enough, if the person changes without feedback, it's not as effective as if they do change with feedback. One of the interesting things that I noticed when doing NLP trainings was if you told the student they were good at something that they weren't good at, they became good at it. Now, I didn't notice this until later, but one time I was, when we owned our radio station, I had a salesperson call me up from Phoenix, and she said, I want to come and work for you. And so I hired her. And when I hired her, when she came in for the beginning interview, I said to her, you know, I have never heard anyone with such a positive approach on the phone in my entire life, and that's the reason why I hired you. And when we did the exit interview several years later, when it was time for her to move on, she said, you know, when you told me that at the beginning of when I began to work for you, she said, I didn't believe that I was really good on the phone. But when you told me that, she said, it totally changed my belief of how good I was on the phone. And so I was so good in prospecting because of what you said to me.
[1587.34 - 1605.84]  So one of the interesting things is if you tell the students that they're good at something and if they're not, they will be good at it. Which is the same thing as these kids are brilliant and you're going to have to struggle to keep up with them. So it's important. Remember the basketball test? I don't know if you heard about this. One-third visualized, one-third played pool, one-third shot baskets.
[1607.58 - 1765.40]  The visualizing group did almost as well as the group that shot baskets. There was no improvement in the ones that shot pool. So the difference is that, what we essentially say from that is that, from a modeling point of view, is that the mind can't tell the difference between, the unconscious mind cannot tell the difference between a real memory and one that is created. And so in the same way, feedback, interestingly enough, if you give positive feedback, then what will happen is the person will change and positively. Remember the person only has seven plus or minus two chunks of attention, so feedback needs to be something they can handle. And it's also important for a person learning something to stay out of the correction mode. So what you want to do is chunk the training at a level where a failure is impossible, where the person succeeds at every step. If you make it too trivial, it could be too easy, which is boredom, but if you make it so they have to stretch and succeed at each level of the training, then that's good. Number seven, visual rehearsal. We talked about that a little bit just a moment ago. Successful people do visual rehearsal each time, dissociated and then associated. Number eight, oh, positive internal dialogue. That's really important. Controlling your internal dialogue is really, really, really, really, really important. There's four things you can do. You can stop it. Just shut off your internal dialogue. That's usually possible if you had been meditating for about 20 years. You can jam the internal dialogue if you want to. And a mantra does that. One of the things that Anthony Robbins did when he set up the firewalk is he has people say the words, cool moss, cool moss, cool moss, for the purpose of jamming the internal dialogue. It was really interesting to me, the University of Hawaii Skeptics Association put together a firewalk the same length as Anthony Robbins' firewalks, and instead of saying kumas, kumas to themselves, as they walked across the hot coals, they said, hot coals, quack, quack, ha, ha, instead of cool moss, cool moss, cool moss, and thus in the newspaper it said that they had successfully proved that the firewalk was a fake. But they didn't realize that hot coals, quack, quack, ha, ha, is just as effective as cool moss, cool moss, cool moss in jamming the internal dialogue. From our point of view as modelers,
[1765.40 - 1785.64]  it was pretty much that they'd successfully jammed the internal dialogue, which is why everyone who walked across the hot coals did it successfully, even with the University of Hawaii Skeptics Association. The content of the mantra that jams it has no, doesn't matter, but it probably ought to be a positive one. You could substitute a positive internal dialogue. That's what we do in pistol shooting. That's what they did in pistol shooting. It was
[1785.64 - 1789.20]  a listing of steps, but you could use positive affirmations. You may need to change the
[1789.20 - 1826.26]  submodalities positive internal dialogue. That's what they did in pistol shooting. It was a listing of steps, but you could use positive affirmations. You may need to change the submodalities of the negative internal dialogue. And the other thing to do is give the internal dialogue something useful and something positive to do. Okay, number nine. Using positive teaching techniques, positive congruency. We talked about that a little bit. Number 10, design small wins. The student wins and is positive at each point. Number 11, while teaching, be a model of excellence. So, um, that doesn't mean you have to be a model of excellence at every moment or in every area of your life, but while you're teaching, it's probably best to be a model of excellence so that the students get the opportunity to look at that.
[1826.54 - 1827.62]  That lets you off the hook, by the way.
[1827.66 - 1843.24]  When you go home and go to sleep, you can be yourself. Or you can be yourself while you're teaching and then go home and not be yourself, or be not yourself, or anyway, never mind. I think you get it. And then number 12, let the people laugh at themselves. It's really important for people to laugh at themselves.
[1843.94 - 1845.70]  When they're laughing, they're learning something.
[1846.32 - 1846.56]  Okay.
[1847.62 - 1865.10]  So that's a quick tour de force of training design and modeling. And what we'd like to do now is to take a short break. I think we should take a quick five-minute break. If you've been listening to this segment on the tape,
[1865.16 - 1865.78]  I think you should probably
[1865.78 - 1866.58]  stop your tape
[1866.58 - 1867.76]  and go and stretch
[1867.76 - 1868.60]  because we're going to do
[1868.60 - 1870.12]  the actual process
[1870.12 - 1871.80]  that we've just learned
[1871.80 - 1872.68]  on how to do modeling.
[1873.42 - 1874.30]  So if you're ready,
[1874.46 - 1875.46]  please stop the tape now
[1875.46 - 1876.10]  and go and stretch
[1876.10 - 1877.14]  and then come back
[1877.14 - 1877.74]  in five minutes.
[1881.22 - 1882.26]  This is the end
[1882.26 - 1884.62]  of Tape 18, Side A.
