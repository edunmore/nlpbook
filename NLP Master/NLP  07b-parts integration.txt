[0.00 - 45.00]  All right, welcome back. How did that last exercise go? Good. Good. Okay, now that we've done that, let's look at the process of how would you do this whole thing now linguistically. I wanted to have you see the linguistic part of it first so that you have the opportunity to see that. There's a number of different ways we can do that. One is the linguistic parts integration that we just went through on page 247.
[47.56 - 47.64]  And another way is, and I'm not sure,
[49.58 - 51.40]  I never know which way is going to work best or which way is going to, which is what's going to happen
[51.40 - 54.08]  when I do, when I work with a client on this.
[54.52 - 56.72]  So we'll just sort of see what happens.
[56.72 - 58.70]  There's another way that it's possible to do it.
[58.90 - 59.94]  The other way to integrate a part
[59.94 - 62.98]  is to apply the behavior against the intention
[62.98 - 127.90]  and use a non-mirror image reverse inductive language pattern. So I'm not sure which will happen. We'll have to see. Who has a part of them that they'd like to... You raised your hand before. Can you tell me what the presenting problem is? Part of me resists the back-of-the-room sales that I need to do. Part of you resists the back-of-the-room sales that you need to do. Come on up. Give him a hand. That's something we definitely want to clear out. Is this the trance chair? Oh, wait, wait. This is the integrative chair. Yeah, we're talking about quantum linguistics here. This is the integrative chair. Okay. yeah we're talking about uh you know quantum yeah no we're talking about quantum linguistics here this is the integrative chair okay this is the chair where all is integrated all is well all is well okay joe so let me just see part of you integrate part of you what i want to tell me about this again part of me resists the uh the back of the room product sales that I need to do in my seminars.
[125.90 - 127.92]  Okay, and what... resists the back-of-the-room product sales that I need to do in my seminars.
[128.44 - 129.06]  Okay.
[130.78 - 131.12]  And what's the purpose in that?
[133.82 - 136.06]  The purpose of it is that I'm not paid enough per seminar to even come close to making a living,
[136.34 - 143.28]  and I need to about sell enough to have commissions from that.
[143.58 - 144.84]  And the part resists that.
[144.94 - 165.34]  What's the part's purpose in resisting that? What would be the part's purpose or intention in resisting having you do back of the room selling? That part of me says that we don't sell. Selling is bad.
[167.46 - 167.80]  In fact, it's a part that has been with me.
[170.08 - 172.02]  I've found myself in selling positions most of my career.
[173.06 - 173.54]  Whoa.
[173.64 - 175.62]  But I have that part that says,
[175.74 - 178.48]  no, no, that's not something the Craigs do.
[179.08 - 179.54]  Oh, really?
[179.70 - 180.16]  That's right.
[180.32 - 181.12]  That's right, yeah.
[187.98 - 189.56]  So that's not something the Craigs do.
[190.22 - 192.60]  And that part, resist sales, because that's not something you do?
[192.72 - 193.38]  That's right.
[193.56 - 194.86]  What's the purpose in doing that?
[195.34 - 196.20]  Help me out with this one.
[197.46 - 199.84]  What's the purpose in resisting the sale?
[200.22 - 201.32]  Because that's not something you do.
[201.34 - 202.20]  What's the purpose in it?
[202.72 - 204.28]  I'm getting the word honor.
[204.86 - 229.08]  Honor. Honor of the family. Family's honor. So let me just ask you a question. May I? Yes. I actually like to ask that part, if I may, the question. The part is the thing. And I wonder if this part would consider in all the things that the Craigs do, if you
[229.08 - 236.40]  could consider one thing, anything that you do, and whatever you do, but specifically
[236.40 - 244.72]  one thing, how much honor is there in not making enough money so that you could make
[244.72 - 266.28]  as much as you want? Right, none. Joe is going through myriad color changes. There's a fair amount of smoke coming out of his ears,
[266.34 - 267.00]  and he's gasping.
[267.48 - 269.18]  But no breath is coming out of him.
[269.32 - 271.42]  He's gasping for not breath.
[271.74 - 272.90]  Now he's gasping for breath.
[273.14 - 274.38]  Okay, now he's got his breath back.
[276.12 - 276.92]  Did I breathe?
[278.74 - 279.56]  Yes, I think you did.
[280.28 - 280.82]  I do, too.
[281.50 - 306.16]  Joe, what was the problem? It'll come. Okay. No, it won't, actually. Something about my... It was a problem, wasn't it? Let me just ask you a question. When you go out into the future and you think about actually going to a seminar, one of yours,
[306.82 - 312.90]  and you're actually noticing if it's okay for you to sell products in the back of the
[312.90 - 318.62]  room and make as much money as you, that is something that Craig's do, is they make as
[318.62 - 345.40]  much money as they deserve to make, don, they, right. They, what'd you say? So, so when you go out in the field, by the way, Joe is considering stuff which is inconsiderable, inconsiderable, unthinkable.
[346.80 - 348.56]  And he's thinking it for the first time because we're asking him, using quantum linguistics,
[348.76 - 349.64]  parts integration now,
[349.90 - 351.92]  to have him think about it in a different way.
[352.62 - 354.60]  He's thinking about it in a whole different way
[354.60 - 355.58]  from what he thought about it.
[356.08 - 358.84]  So we've actually run back and forth across the boundaries.
[359.32 - 360.46]  So I want you to go out in the future
[360.46 - 366.08]  and notice if you're selling with honor.
[369.58 - 366.08] 
[366.10 - 370.10]  Thank you for watching. in the future, and notice if you're selling with honor.
[372.28 - 372.54]  Yeah, that's the only way to do it.
[372.74 - 373.00]  Yeah.
[373.24 - 374.42]  Yeah.
[375.62 - 375.74]  I mean, it's right.
[377.02 - 379.80]  And that is how you do it, isn't it?
[381.82 - 384.22]  Yeah, yeah, yes.
[384.84 - 384.98]  With honor.
[385.00 - 386.16]  You wanted to change, haven't you?
[387.82 - 388.26]  Right.
[389.90 - 391.16]  So let me just ask you,
[391.18 - 393.18]  and I'm not going to make any suggestions about this.
[393.52 - 393.96]  Good.
[394.12 - 394.34]  Okay.
[396.02 - 397.54]  I wouldn't want you to.
[398.30 - 400.54]  We both said that nodding our heads, by the way.
[400.58 - 401.02]  Yes.
[401.64 - 403.12]  So I want you to go out in the future
[403.12 - 404.22]  to another time in the future
[404.22 - 446.66]  when you'd be called upon to sell a product in the back of the room. And notice if you can do that now comfortably and feel good about it. Honestly. Honestly, I can. And honorably? Yes, yes, yes. The only things i will sell and i will sell things uh i'll only sell the things that i feel honorable about good good good that's good yeah that's you know that's good i've got to be integrated with with that oh yeah absolutely yeah no i'm with you on that one totally okay all right let me ask you one final question. There was a part of you that, can I talk to that part?
[447.28 - 466.66]  Sure, sure. Is the part there or has it disappeared? I'd like to know. I'm just doing one final test just for demonstration purposes. Normally I would not ask the client to talk to the part again unless I was unsure whether or not it had totally integrated. But I'm going to ask Joe, just so y'all can see where Joe's at with the part.
[467.12 - 487.46]  No, I don't, I really don't. I don't feel it. Before, it was just, you know, right there. But I don't know. I don't feel it. Cool. Cool. So when you go out and make as much money as you deserve, honorably, call me. I will. I want to hear about your success. Okay. Give him a hand. Thanks, Jeff. Good
[487.46 - 502.64]  job. Okay, so here's the deal. The tip-off when you actually do this is the client going, what did you notice that
[502.64 - 567.18]  okay murray Did you notice that? Okay, Murray. Want to play? Come on up. Give him a hand. We don't know what's up with Murray, but he raised his hand earlier. Or at least part of him did. And we want to see what's up. What's up? What's the plan? A part of me feels like I never seem to know enough to use all this stuff. It's like, and this is kind of cross-contextual. I have to bite my tongue, you know. Do you already have the intervention yet? Okay, so part of you feels like you don't know enough to use this right uh it's like i read mass quantities of books and listen to thousands of hours of tape and you know you know what i love about this i just don't feel like i know enough yeah no one else in the audience has that problem no one else listening to the tapes has that problem. Well, that makes me
[567.18 - 570.80]  concerned because, see, I had this idea about going on to do the trainer stuff, and I go,
[570.92 - 575.62]  well, how am I ever going to do this if I don't feel like I know enough? Exactly. You
[575.62 - 645.10]  know what I mean? I do. Thanks for, thanks for, I appreciate you checking the mail. So, Murray, let me just ask you a question. The part that says you don't know enough. Right. How does it know that? That's a good question. In fact, I wonder if that part could think of all the things it doesn't know right now and that it doesn't know let me just ask that part may I ask that part of the question yeah what's its purpose in having you think you don't know enough? Well, I wouldn't want to use this information unwisely or without integrity, and I wouldn't want to make mistakes. Well, let me just say a couple things here. One is, does integrity have anything to do with how much you know?
[646.02 - 646.86]  Not necessarily.
[647.08 - 648.74]  Okay.
[650.38 - 651.10]  And unwisely, of course.
[652.86 - 656.04]  I mean, that has something to do with how much you know.
[656.74 - 659.06]  Or does it?
[663.18 - 663.26]  I mean, well, not specifically necessarily about a quantity of what I know,
[664.86 - 728.44]  but how you use it, I guess. So it's not really how much you know, is it? It's what you do with what you know, I guess. So let me just mention one thing, if I may, with regard to if I could talk to this part. Okay. This part is actually, because let me see if I can get really clear about what it's doing here. This part itself wants you to know more. Yes. But it's telling you you don't know enough. Right. That's right. so when will you ever know enough to know that? You know enough. I don't know. I don't know enough to know that. I'm going to describe here, I don't know that.
[729.72 - 729.80]  I'm going to describe here.
[731.44 - 735.54]  Murphy is beet red.
[736.26 - 736.36]  Beet red.
[737.28 - 737.36]  Smoke's coming out of his ears.
[737.88 - 738.00]  He's sweating.
[738.56 - 740.10]  You're sweating.
[742.96 - 744.10]  I mean, we are in Hawaii, but it's sort of an overcast day.
[744.84 - 746.64]  Do you know enough?
[747.70 - 751.72]  About what?
[754.06 - 754.40]  Yeah, um... Hi.
[760.72 - 762.02]  Hi, Raymarie, how are you?
[763.52 - 764.04]  Fried.
[764.04 - 764.16]  Fried.
[768.30 - 769.16]  Welcome back.
[769.90 - 769.16] 
[768.00 - 769.18]  We'll be Welcome back.
[769.86 - 770.56]  Where have I been?
[771.70 - 772.06]  Kona?
[773.28 - 775.04]  I've been here for three days.
[777.26 - 778.84]  Your planet is nice.
[780.06 - 781.40]  Thank you, thank you.
[783.68 - 784.40]  Okay.
[865.74 - 888.70]  Welcome back. Yeah, thanks back do you know enough I hope so yeah what when you go out in the future yeah I don't mean to the near future but maybe a week from now two weeks from now okay when you're finished this training or even perhaps when you've completed the trainers training okay you know what I mean? Yeah. You'll be there, won't you? I will be there. Yes, I will be there. Do you know enough? I mean, to teach. I'm not suggesting you know everything, because, of course, you don't know everything. I'd like to. Consciously. And you still have a desire to learn learn but is it enough for you to begin to use the material I guess you get well let's go back to two weeks from now when you think about that two weeks from now okay you've completed the master practitioner training and all the stuff you've already learned in practitioner is that enough for you to begin using the material? Comfortably? Yeah, I guess so. I guess so. But you're not sure? See, I'm a real bug on testing. Testing's very important when you do actually anything, and I'm really solid on testing. I don't get that we're totally congruent yet, and I'm going to push for for congruency so this is a really good example because some of the other folks have been real congruent I'm not sure Murray's done so let's test so when you think of using the material how do you feel about it let's say right now, the stuff you already learned right up to this point do you feel you can use it is it possible for you to use it Do you, and can you use it comfortably?
[885.16 - 908.54]  Well, up to a point, but I don't feel that good about my skill level, of course. So you need more practice? Oh, yeah. Okay. Let me ask you this, because the presenting problem was you felt like you didn't know enough. Uh-huh. Do you know enough? well I'm going to have to learn it as I go really
[908.54 - 965.72]  or do you know enough. Do you know enough? Well, I'm going to have to learn it as I go, really. Or do you know enough right now to do the practitioner-level stuff? Yeah, I guess, to some degree. I guess, okay. To some degree. All right. So this is good. This is good. So what is it that prevents you from using the practitioner-level stuff easily? Not wanting to be wrong or make mistakes. Excellent. That's good. So, would you say that you're, would you say that you're concerned about making mistakes or would you say that, I mean if I, I want to check some or are you perhaps're concerned about making mistakes? Or would you say that, I mean, if I want to check some ecology here, are you perhaps overly concerned about making mistakes? Probably so. Yeah, because if you pay attention to ecology, will you make mistakes? I mean, or even if you do, can you correct them if you pay attention to the ecology? Well, yeah, because the only way
[965.72 - 966.12]  you can learn
[966.12 - 966.82]  is you've got to do it.
[967.02 - 967.92]  Right, okay.
[968.02 - 968.64]  I just don't like
[968.64 - 969.44]  that idea, I guess.
[969.94 - 971.42]  You don't like the idea
[971.42 - 971.86]  of doing it?
[971.98 - 972.50]  Well, no.
[972.86 - 973.26]  By the way,
[973.36 - 974.10]  I want to be the Buddha.
[975.12 - 975.78]  Oh, you just want
[975.78 - 976.46]  to sit there and be.
[977.66 - 978.08]  All right.
[978.88 - 979.38]  Okay, Murray,
[979.46 - 980.20]  so think about this
[980.20 - 987.56]  for just a minute. Is there, is there, so let me, so let me talk to the part of you that we originally were working with. Okay. Can I talk to that part? Sure. Okay. What's
[987.56 - 1045.52]  that part's highest intention or highest purpose at this point? Learning, but not making mistakes at it or something like that I got it okay well. Well, it's, okay, maybe it's actually, it's like it's trying to achieve perfection or something like that. It's trying to achieve, like, some sort of total perfection. Got it. Instantly or something like that. Great. So that part, this is great. So now we've gotten to the highest intention. So that part thinks that you have to be perfect to do anything, do anything. So in the meanwhile, you're not doing anything until you're perfect. Is that right? Well, let me just mention something.
[1045.88 - 1046.00]  Okay.
[1068.76 - 1070.04]  Anything less than total freedom to use this is not perfection. Anything less than total freedom to use this is not perfection. I wonder if that part
[1070.04 - 1070.62]  could consider
[1070.62 - 1072.26]  that anything less
[1072.26 - 1073.62]  than total freedom
[1073.62 - 1074.58]  to use this material
[1074.58 - 1075.60]  freely
[1075.60 - 1077.10]  is not perfection.
[1081.66 - 1082.34]  Wow.
[1085.82 - 1086.86]  What does that part
[1086.86 - 1087.44]  think about that?
[1089.58 - 1087.44] 
[1166.50 - 1172.30]  Thank you. Wow. What does that part think about that? Seems like it makes sense. Makes sense, yeah. And when that part, as you think about it, does that ring true for you? Almost. Almost. Okay. All right. So let me talk to that part, if I may. Okay. Okay? And I wonder if that part could come out and stand on which hand would it like? This hand. Okay. And this is the part that's not allowing you to use an LP. Right. Okay. What you learned. perfectly. There's a part, I'm sure, with which this part is most in conflict, because we wouldn't have talked otherwise, right? I mean, you wouldn't have raised your hand. So is there another part that that part is most in conflict? Would that part like to come out and stand on the other end? What part is this part here? It's kind of a fun part. Learning is fun or something else like that, but it's a happy part. This part here in your right hand? Yeah. This part's more serious. Does this look like someone you know? Well, yeah, it's sort of a geeky me. This part over here, does this look like someone you know? Well, this is the academic version over here sort of okay and this part over here does this look like someone you know
[1172.30 - 1175.74]  uh well yeah that's that's the little kid in me that's the fun learning part
[1175.74 - 1178.20]  oh cool and this part's sort of like with a mouth buckle or something
[1178.20 - 1185.10]  okay so this part's this part has the highest intention it's what
[1185.10 - 1188.30]  learning but it wants me to be perfect for what purpose
[1188.30 - 1226.86]  Thank you. Okay, so this part has a highest intention. It's what? Learning, but it wants me to be perfect. For what purpose? That's a good question. We're asking Marie to dunk up outside of the boundaries of the part. So we still, even though we got all the way to perfection, still we're not outside the boundaries of the part yet. So we're still asking him to go now outside of the boundaries of the part, or outside of the constraints of the thinking of the part. So we're asking him to contemplate something that is uncontemplatableemplatable for the part at this point. So what's the purpose?
[1229.30 - 1230.08]  For what purpose?
[1230.28 - 1230.92]  What's it going to get you?
[1234.78 - 1236.80]  Well, if I'm perfect, then I won't make mistakes.
[1237.64 - 1238.98]  I won't do anything wrong.
[1239.44 - 1242.14]  I'd like to point out that that's actually a downward chunk.
[1242.96 - 1243.32]  Okay.
[1244.18 - 1271.78]  So perfection for what purpose well i feel good about using all this stuff to feel good for what and what is that again well i'll be happy about it all yeah i'll be Yeah. Murray, I'm not suggesting this,
[1271.82 - 1273.16]  but your hands are actually moving together.
[1276.90 - 1278.90]  By the way, Murray just turned red again.
[1280.08 - 1280.70]  Beat red.
[1280.86 - 1281.54]  He's starting to sweat.
[1281.66 - 1282.56]  His hands are moving together.
[1283.88 - 1366.18]  Murray, before those hands totally come together, there are other parts that were once part of a larger whole that integrated these two parts together. Is that correct? Were there? What? Just allow those to integrate, too, at the end. Before your hands come together, make sure the integration is totally and completely complete as they come together. Just allow them to continue to come together. And integrate right now. That's good. And just nice color shift. Murray brings the part inside automatically, breathes it in. So even though we got a a nice shift with the linguistic parts integration, I wasn't willing to stop there because I didn't get congruency. I'm going to test again for congruency now. Welcome back. So two planets in one day. I'm going to hit you with this piece of trivia the movie The Day the Earth Stood Still Klaatu Barada Nikto Klaatu Barada Nikto that's it okay you win the prize that was the secret word of the day you're welcome the prize was parts integration by the changing the subject, let's go back and see where you're at.
[1366.48 - 1382.64]  How do you feel about using this material? Pretty good. Okay, good. Now... Is that something you can do? Yeah. Okay, good. Now that's... That's no longer, I guess so. Give him a hand. Thank you, Murray. Good job. Well... Yeah. Excellent, excellent.
[1384.30 - 1386.60]  Murray got two parts integration for the price of one.
[1387.00 - 1406.86]  Okay, so let's unpack that like what happened there one of the things I want to point so we'll go back and look at the whole thing we did a linguistic parts integration we got a nice color shift it means something integrated but the presenting problem didn't disappear so when you do quantum linguistics if the presenting problem doesn't disappear hey, you're not quantum linguistics, if the presenting problem doesn't disappear, hey,
[1406.86 - 1407.86]  you're not done.
[1407.86 - 1408.86]  I mean, you could see a nice color shift.
[1408.86 - 1411.60]  Client could go into the void, come back, and go, wow, I'm transformed.
[1411.60 - 1421.00]  But if you, like for me, I'm looking at the presenting problem. Presenting problem's still there. I want the client to go and, you know, and let's get to,
[1421.10 - 1423.64]  when we test in future pace, we've got to have congruency.
[1424.38 - 1549.56]  So when Murray got to happy, when Murray got to both parts happy, did you notice that I was actually pointing to each of the hands and I went like this, right? Which is instructions at the, I actually took my right finger and pointed to his left hand and his left finger to his right hand and then moved them across quickly, indicating that the hands should come together. And the hands began to come together even more quickly at that point. So I was using nonverbal suggestion in the process of doing parts integration. And I think you should use, if you have the parts out on a hand, you should do nonverbal suggestion when you do parts integration. so he got to, he got to both parts where the highest intention was happy, we got those together, and then we actually got the integration in that way. Are there any questions about anything that went on here with Murray? No. Okay, good. Okay then, just one more thing before we finish the entire notion of language and parts, and that's page 248. I'd like to point out one more thing. I think we've had a tour de force of parts today, and I'm really pleased with where we got to. There's a lot of things that you can do with parts, and we're looking at page 248 and slide number 68. and there's a number of things that you can do with parts. And we're looking at page 248 and slide number 68. And there's a number of things that you can do with parts. And the final thing is I'd like to point out that in some cases, you may find the parts organized hierarchically. So that would mean that with some clients, there could be, with any given part, a part which was in charge of that part, with any given part, a part in charge of that part, a part in charge of that part, and a part in charge of that part. Easy for him to say. Part of me thinks that. And it's possible that there could be a whole hierarchy of parts. that's another way to think of parts
[1549.56 - 1547.88]  and one of the it's possible that there could be a whole hierarchy of parts.
[1550.66 - 1550.96]  That's another way to think of parts and one other possibility.
[1554.40 - 1554.78]  And then there's this, and so let's just see if this,
[1558.14 - 1559.88]  would somebody like to look at doing this real quickly?
[1561.82 - 1562.04]  And I'll have you come up here to do it.
[1563.84 - 1587.50]  Is to integrate a bunch of parts all at once. Would anybody like to do that just to see what happens? Yeah? Okay. Come on up. Give her a hand. Okay, Linda. So let me just ask you a question. Would you say that you have some parts at the unconscious level? Yes. Okay. Now, before we actually do anything specifically,
[1587.80 - 1603.62]  let me talk for a moment. One of the things you can do is if you get a certain part out on the hand and you're going for a higher level of integration, you can chunk up on the part, on any part that you work with by saying, I'd like to talk to the part that's in charge of this part. this particular script on page 248
[1603.62 - 1605.30]  actually goes right to the top
[1605.30 - 1607.98]  this script on page 248
[1607.98 - 1705.10]  goes right to the top. This script on page 248 goes right to the top. So let's just see what happens, Linda, when we do this. And can you sort of, what I'd like you to do, if you would, is to sort of get an idea of the level of parts, I don't know, maybe you could ask your unconscious mind, since you're good at communicating with your unconscious mind, what sort of amount of, or like, a level of parts that you have right now, and it doesn't need to be a number or anything, because we'll just, we'll look and see what the change is afterward. The level without knowing the number? Yeah, you could have a number, if you want to have a number, or if you could have, if If this is right now 100% of where you're at right now, I'm going to ask you for another number later on after we get done with this process, just to see. Well, an age comes to pop up in my mind. Okay. 14, age of 14, as far as level. Okay, and I'm not thinking so much of age as the number of parts at the unconscious level or the amount of non-integration that there is present. So less of an age and more of like a number of parts or whatever. So you don't have to give me that number, but let's just say that we took the number of parts that you have right now as 100%. And I'm going to ask you to how much closer you are when we're done with this process. Okay, now I understand. Okay. Yeah. Yep. Okay, so I wonder if I could talk, just for a moment, to the part of you that has no other function but to sort of catalog and keep track of all of the parts at the unconscious level. Okay.
[1731.98 - 1805.68]  And I'd like to ask that part, what's its highest purpose? Which, when fulfilled now, will allow that part and a lot of others to integrate into the unconscious mind totally and completely right now. Now, notice I'm calibrating her for talking to apart. And we'll see what happens. Well, its purpose was safety, but they're really all together. But it seemed like they would just come out when they want to come out. Was that easy for you to describe? So let me just ask you a question. In terms of integration, because you noticed something happened. Yeah, they all kind of lined up. You noticed something happening? Yeah. So in terms of if we were at 100% before, where are we now? Well, they're all lined up. So they're all totally aligned. Are they lined up or are they all integrated? They're lined up like in a line, like they're waiting for instructions. Excellent. So here's the instructions. Ask them to consider the highest intention of you as an individual. Total being. And as they consider their highest intention,
[1805.82 - 1806.42]  their highest purpose,
[1807.50 - 1811.24]  I wonder if they could go ahead
[1811.24 - 1812.62]  and get in touch with that purpose,
[1812.82 - 1813.90]  name that purpose now,
[1814.92 - 1816.00]  which, when complete,
[1817.50 - 1818.52]  would allow them all to integrate
[1818.52 - 1833.62]  at the unconscious level. Keep breathing.
[1842.24 - 1844.16]  Now, Linda, along the way, I'd like to suggest that
[1844.16 - 1845.54]  if there's any learnings to preserve,
[1846.92 - 1849.06]  that you go ahead and preserve the learnings.
[1852.82 - 1854.42]  And allow your unconscious mind
[1854.42 - 1856.04]  to totally integrate at the unconscious level
[1856.04 - 1856.88]  and be whole and complete.
[1864.36 - 1905.38]  That's much better. Okay. Wow. It's hot in here. Is it? It must be the energy that totally freed up the unconscious level. Linda is actually wiping her eyes. She had some tears in his mouth. There's actually additional moisture on her. If I could do a sensory-based description.
[1905.86 - 1907.12]  There's additional moisture on her forehead
[1907.12 - 1910.80]  and on her palms.
[1910.98 - 1911.68]  Yeah, it's hot.
[1911.88 - 1912.04]  Okay.
[1912.38 - 1913.60]  It's actually an overcast day here.
[1913.82 - 1914.94]  Oh, it's hot.
[1918.12 - 1918.66]  Good job.
[1918.70 - 1920.98]  Now let me ask you a question, just for fun.
[1921.74 - 1924.28]  If we were at 100% before in terms of number of parts,
[1924.32 - 1928.00]  what percentage would you say we're at now?
[1928.00 - 1931.00]  Overall. 100.
[1931.00 - 1941.00]  So you're 100% before in terms of level of parts. Not level of integration, level of parts. What percentage of parts are there now?
[1941.00 - 1944.00]  It's only me.
[1944.00 - 1988.34]  Well, good. Just me. That's good. That's really good. I'm very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very Linda. Good job. Thank you. Yeah, you bet. Now, I don't know what that's useful for. Let's see. reintegrating at the unconscious level totally and completely now so that you were a whole integrated. I think that's something, whatever that is. What's that? It is the enlightenment. I actually had to calibrate her. We integrated the controller part, but all the other parts were then waiting. Usually all the other parts go with the controller part, because it's a hierarchical thing. Her
[1988.34 - 2004.66]  parts just lined up, so I gave them instructions to integrate. They actually integrated. And what you'll find is a lot more congruency now at the unconscious level. I think, Linda, you'll find yourself a lot more congruent, a lot more centered. Yeah. And our point of you in this little branch of NLP is that we don't need parts to function, because your
[2004.66 - 2008.28]  unconscious mind can do it very well, thank you very much, at the unconscious level. So
[2008.28 - 2027.66]  wholeness and completeness is probably a higher state of functioning and a higher ability to be able to produce integrated, whole, complete behavior. Just know one thing. If you actually go for an integration of all the parts that once you, you may, depending on the client and how much work the client has done on themselves,
[2027.76 - 2043.66]  you may have other timeline therapy or other things to do. I would suggest before you go for an entire integration at the unconscious level that you would want to, if you're talking to a client, you'd want to look out at the client and notice how much other work they've done with themselves because I would plan more than five minutes to do it
[2043.66 - 2045.74]  because the client may have other things necessary
[2045.74 - 2046.88]  that needed to be handled along the way.
[2047.98 - 2046.88]  Okay, that's just sort of a disclaimer and a caveat. themselves, because you may, I would plan more than like five minutes to do it, because the client may have other things necessary that needed to be handled along the way.
[2047.98 - 2052.48]  Okay, that's just sort of a disclaimer and a caveat, if you intend to do this, but I
[2052.48 - 2055.04]  personally think that the more integrated we can be at the unconscious level, the better.
[2057.76 - 2060.24]  This is the end of tape seven, side B.
