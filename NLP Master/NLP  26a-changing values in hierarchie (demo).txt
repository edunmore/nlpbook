[0.00 - 67.08]  Okay, next thing we might do is to look and see what we might do as an intervention. So I would like to demonstrate two possible interventions, which we're going to do. And we're going to have to ask Sun to come back up on the stage. And Sun, please give Sun a hand. Thanks for coming, Sun. And Sun had some revelations in the middle of the night, which probably are as uncomfortable as what matthew experienced so that's good so me you know yeah to me it's like to me when a client calls me up and says oh my god i just realized something terrible i go all right because when you realize something like that then you can then you can begin to make some change so son what did you what did you realize last night in the middle of thinking about or maybe not thinking about all this some was in the night one one was in the night it wasn't a big thing that was a little thing um this one was a little one but I think it could be relevant the paid well was a big one too because so I'm not in debt
[67.08 - 68.36]  because I have massive debt.
[68.94 - 70.44]  So that actually was...
[70.44 - 72.38]  So that's more than 60% away from it.
[72.54 - 73.08]  I think so.
[73.16 - 74.00]  What would you say it is?
[75.98 - 76.46]  90.
[77.94 - 80.64]  So we'll change that to 90% away from it.
[80.64 - 83.58]  So that was kind of like, I mean, that changes it,
[83.64 - 86.06]  but that wasn't the one that really, like, just...
[86.06 - 88.00]  One of them sort of freaked you out.
[88.12 - 88.34]  Yeah.
[88.66 - 89.16]  What was that?
[105.16 - 108.88]  The success. This is when I was, like, sort of went into this altered state. I was, like, power walking and thinking about these things. That's number eight on the list here. Yeah, so it's down there. But I was just sort of running through it. like success well why is that so important it's so important because I don't want to fail that's really important and then I said I would rather
[108.88 - 105.98]  die than fail I was just sort of running through it. It's like success, well, why is that so important? And it's so important because I don't want to fail.
[106.34 - 186.58]  That's really important. And then I said I would rather die than fail. Cool. So that's more than 45. It feels like more than 45% to me. Yeah. What would it be? Oh, it's totally away. It's like totally away. Whoa. So that's 100%. Yeah. Excellent. That's really good. That's fabulous. It makes my hands sweat, though, to say that. I mean, and it just blurred it out. It was like I would rather die. It was like it spit out. That's great, son. That's great. Because until you discover how it is at the unconscious level, how are we going to make change? Right? And I know somebody who died rather, my father, I would say he chose to die rather than fail what he thought was failing. That's fabulous. Because I went, what a weird thing, and I went, that's who did that. That's fabulous. That's excellent. That's really exquisite. I'd like to work on that first, if we could. I'd like to demonstrate a number of interventions. And I think what I'd like to do, let's see, is I'd like to do the intervention on success. Oh, there was one more. I don't think it's that big of a deal, but again, it's just... Yeah, no, tell me. I want to hear it. The fun and joy that bothered me yesterday, because I just kept thinking, well, so I've worked in jobs that weren't all that fun,
[186.92 - 204.94]  but it didn't seem to be that compelling. But then I realized, it's like the words just came out, I was brought up in like this joyless household. And that seemed to have more of a grip than just, somehow that just didn't seem like that big of a deal. I don't know if it is okay so like what would be the percentage if you were to
[204.94 - 268.36]  reevaluate that one? Well, 80 is coming out. This, by the way, see, we saw Sun totally congruent yesterday in terms of these percentages, and this is why one of the things is that you might want to meet with a client over more than one day, especially when doing a personal breakthrough session or using NLP for the purpose of enhancing performance and in this case what we see is we see that sun had a chance to think about it her unconscious mind and what happened is on slide 151 is the unconscious mind got to light up more neural networks as she thought about it and probably sun had to do some internal processing about it too well because yesterday it just didn just didn't seem unsettled, but I didn't know why. It was like, oh. Yeah, well, now you know. Now I know. Okay, this is fabulous. Okay, so here's what I'd like to do. I'd like to demonstrate, let's see, oh, and fun and joy, okay. What I'd like to do is I'd like to demonstrate timeline therapy as an intervention for letting go of away froms. Now, admittedly, those of you listening to these tapes
[268.36 - 305.58]  have not yet studied any timeline therapy, but this is a place where we would use a timeline therapy intervention. So I'd like to demonstrate that. And what I want to say is that the timeline therapy master practitioner training tape set, the black tape set, is quite vital in this regard for learning timeline therapy, so much of what I do may not be obvious unless you have a background or understand what timeline therapy is about or how to do it. For those of you who are here, I assure you that when we get into our timeline therapy section, that we'll unpack and explain all of those things that we're about to do. Okay, son.
[306.60 - 306.78]  My heart's racing.
[365.00 - 365.20]  And you're gripping the chair. I am. It's okay, you can grip the chair. We don't provide seatbelts, so you may want to hold on. So let me fall out. Yeah, you won't. You'll be all right. Okay, so success. And you've noticed that there's a real big away from. and the issue for success is you'd rather die than fail. And you're not the person that first did that. Now, as I talk to her, I'm lighting up the neural networks, right? So you're not the person who first actually did that or who first talked about that. Who was, so? He didn't talk about it, but he did. It's your dad. Your dad did it. He died. He died at 42 because he thought that he wasn't a success and he really I mean I think that he was but he it was never enough and that's that's the other never enough that's the other big thing that came oh cool right I don't think anybody else in the class can relate to that that's the other thing.
[368.94 - 369.40]  For me, it's that nothing that I do is ever enough.
[374.54 - 374.66]  I can have a hundred, what are those called, feedback sheets saying,
[376.14 - 376.28]  fabulous, fabulous, fabulous, fabulous,
[380.16 - 380.58]  and I will still say all the things that could have done better.
[382.68 - 383.60]  Once in a while, it's like, yeah, I did a good job.
[383.92 - 384.60]  Excellent.
[406.04 - 406.10]  This is great. What a great opportunity. Because a lot of you think I'm just working on Sun and of course if we were to ask Carl Jung or perhaps even Carl pre broom they would say that we're at at some level of the universe we'reically. Okay, Sun, so your neural nets are lit up.
[406.68 - 407.84]  I can see that.
[408.34 - 408.46]  Aren't they?
[408.86 - 409.08]  You're in it.
[409.62 - 409.74]  You're right in it.
[410.18 - 410.46]  Okay, Sun.
[421.46 - 421.70]  So we're going to do timeline therapy, first of all, as a demonstration. And you have a timeline. I know you know that. And you've done timeline therapy before. but just for elicitation's sake.
[423.10 - 423.52]  Where's your past and where's your future?
[424.60 - 424.92]  If you knew, your past would be?
[426.58 - 426.64]  My future's right that way.
[426.86 - 427.18]  Whoa.
[428.14 - 425.94]  And my past... The sun is pointing off into her right. sake where's your past and where's your future if you knew your past would be my future's right
[425.94 - 431.94]  that way whoa and my past son is pointing off into her right and her past she's pointing behind her
[431.94 - 436.48]  to the left and it's off to her left behind her and you floated above your timeline before
[436.48 - 443.10]  have you not yeah all right so let me ask you a question the first time that this issue of success
[443.10 - 449.92]  became an issue and from what we know you you've already told me that it was an issue for your
[449.92 - 466.60]  Thank you for watching. The first time that this issue of success became an issue, and from what we know, you've already told me that it was an issue for your father. So what I want to ask you is, what's the source of this issue of success or the sort of decision that I'd rather die than fail? What's the source of that, the root cause of which, if we disconnected it, would allow that to disappear as an issue for you,
[466.60 - 484.92]  if you were to know? When was that first event where that decision was made? Was it before, during, or after your birth? Before. It was before. And was it in the womb or before? Before. Before. So assuming that it was before that, was it in past life or genealogical? passed down to you genealogically
[484.92 - 485.92]  or from a past life?
[486.12 - 486.68]  Genealogical.
[486.78 - 487.38]  Genealogical.
[487.84 - 485.92]  And how many generations back Assuming that it was before that, was it in past life or genealogical? Passed down to you genealogically or from a past life?
[486.22 - 486.70]  Genealogical.
[486.86 - 487.38]  Genealogical.
[488.12 - 503.26]  And how many generations back does it go? Of course, we knew it was genealogical already, didn't we? But I wanted to demonstrate the process because she talked about her father. So how far back in your family does that go? One, I think. One generation. Is that one generation before your father or just your father?
[503.36 - 504.12]  I think my father.
[504.26 - 504.82]  Just your father.
[505.10 - 505.30]  Okay.
[506.10 - 506.46]  Excellent.
[506.70 - 566.92]  Okay, son, so would you please, if you would, just go ahead and float, trusting your unconscious mind, and just go ahead and float right up above your timeline. And what I'd like you to do is to float back into the past. Just float right back into the past. and what I'd like you to do is go back to that event where your father decided that he'd rather die than fail. And I'd like you to, just so we can gather some information about the negative emotions present, would you go back to that event and float right down into the event? And just sort of, when you're there, you can tell me. And what I want you to do is just get in touch with the emotions that are there and the decision. So we're going to float right back down into position number four. That's not real comfortable, is it? Do you have a sense of what the emotions are that are present? Sun is actually sort of grimacing as we notice that perhaps she's floating down into the event.
[569.12 - 570.38]  It's a fear and anger.
[570.54 - 571.42]  Fear and anger. Okay, good, Sun.
[571.46 - 572.40]  Come right back up out of there.
[573.12 - 575.04]  And what I'd like you to do is go back to position three.
[575.20 - 576.78]  So you're above the event and before the event,
[577.38 - 579.94]  well before any of the events that led to that event.
[581.26 - 645.08]  So you're above the event and before the event, and you're well before any of the events that, even before the events that led to it. And as you turn and look toward now, the question is now, where are those emotions? Sun smiling, little chuckle. Where did they go? I'm not sure. I didn't think they'd go that they went more quickly than you thought okay son and the decision that was there I read I didn't feel where did that go it it disappeared didn't it yeah I didn't I yeah I wasn't even aware of it when I was down there let's go back inside and make sure it's totally gone okay so why don't you float down into the event once again. Float right down into position four. The sun's smiling now. It's fine, huh? It's flat. Flat. Excellent, excellent. It's flat. My heart's doing just a little thing, though. Well, what's that about?
[649.52 - 650.74]  Something about uncertainty.
[651.54 - 652.26]  Uncertainty about?
[652.44 - 655.14]  About what's going to happen in life.
[655.42 - 655.78]  Perfect.
[657.78 - 659.12]  Remember what I said on the first day?
[661.80 - 685.06]  About if you're not investing enough? Well, let's put it this way. If you're not uncertain about what's going to happen, you may not be investing enough. Okay. If I could suggest some learnings. Okay. Does that work for you? Yeah. Great.
[685.08 - 686.40]  Why don't you float back up to position three?
[686.94 - 687.26]  Okay.
[705.54 - 705.08]  And, son, what I'd like to ask you to do is I'd like you to come back above your timeline, all the way along your father's timeline. Come back above your timeline and make sure you let go of any other negative emotions that are related to the issue of success, as well as to allow all the events between then and now to reevaluate
[705.08 - 765.04]  themselves in such a way that as you come back to now, your success only becomes more assured. And I'd like you to notice at least three events in the past where you could have been totally successful and felt as though you could have been totally successful. Me or him? Well, him while you're coming back up above his timeline, and then you when you're coming onto your timeline. And notice at least three events where you could have been totally successful and the issue of failure wasn't even an issue, that it was totally something that you could conceive of your success and really feel good about it. And do that, if you would, all the way back to now. You can tell me when you're back to now. Sun is going through some physiological shifts which we can see here. Shift in color and breathing. Shift in shoulder movement. Her shoulders are moving back and forth she's sitting
[765.04 - 786.52]  up straighter now than she was and there's a smile the corners of her lips are upturned as a in the position of smiling are you back it now I'm really close okay and back okay good please float down into now come on back in the room.
[788.52 - 805.00]  Whoa. That's how I always have to come back. Yeah, right. All right, welcome back. That was good. Good job. It went rather quickly, didn't it? Okay. Now, what Sun and I want to do right now is we want to have a little discussion
[805.00 - 808.24]  such that it gives your unconscious mind time
[808.24 - 809.86]  to integrate the changes that we've just made
[809.86 - 811.14]  without mentioning them.
[812.68 - 814.50]  So I might say, I might be inclined to say something like,
[814.96 - 815.80]  do you smell popcorn?
[817.74 - 819.24]  No, but I smelled toast earlier.
[819.62 - 820.68]  You smelled toast earlier, yeah.
[820.68 - 823.82]  That was your negative emotions, actually.
[905.06 - 905.24]  They're toast. they're gone they're gone well here we are in Kona nice view sunny today too looking towards the light yeah all right son so let's look at your values hierarchy here what's up with what's up with that number eight value there? What's up with the issue of success? What's up with it? Yeah, and I'm not concerned right now about the relative relationship of it in the hierarchy. Just as you think of success, what comes up for you? Warmth. Warmth? Yeah, so you're feeling that inside. That's different from what you were feeling last night. This morning. Well, last night and much different from what you're feeling this morning. Yes. So as you go inside and ask your unconscious mind, was there, is there any away from that's left on that value? Or is it toward? I think it's toward. You think it's toward or it is toward? Well, it is toward. I just thought it would be a little bit more difficult than that. Well, son, it is more difficult than this. In fact, what we'd like you to do is when we're done is to jog around the hotel a hundred times.
[906.12 - 906.28]  I can do that.
[906.76 - 907.90]  I know you can.
[909.06 - 912.26]  And then do a hundred push-ups only to have it be...
[912.26 - 914.06]  Just kidding.
[915.64 - 916.64]  People say to me all the time
[916.64 - 917.62]  it shouldn't be this difficult.
[918.20 - 918.82]  I mean, it's easy.
[918.92 - 919.30]  It shouldn't be.
[919.36 - 920.48]  And I agree, it shouldn't be.
[922.16 - 923.06]  But it is.
[924.00 - 947.70]  And we've had to apologize for that before. Okay, son. So just for fun, just for fun, let me, I have a different color pen here. As you look at this, as you look, and we're not going to make any other shifts, but they may have, other values may have changed. We're not going to do anything yet about that. I just want to ask her, what's the relative, as you look at success, is that the right place for it? No. No. That's congruent.
[947.78 - 987.48]  Where should it be, then? My eyes go to three. Three, okay. My head was saying four. Four, okay. Well, let's just say that something happened here. We'll cross off that number so we know that something happened there. Can I say something? You've got a microphone. One other thing that I realized is that, and not totally on my own, I have to admit that there's a tall Finnish person who, who, um, we were talking, and, and I realized, because I'm fiercely, I, like, guard my independence fiercely, fiercely.
[987.76 - 987.98]  Fiercely.
[987.98 - 991.00]  I mean, I got married and left for three months to go travel on my own.
[991.08 - 1004.76]  It doesn't, you know, make a lot of sense, but, so that happens, and I have a lot of fun. Yeah. And I'm real curious. Yeah. and yet you know actually I've been successful I just you know hadn't
[1004.76 - 1009.14]  recognized it but like this is really down there because I so being paid well
[1009.14 - 1066.50]  is down there yeah we're going to talk about that today you and i okay but i just wanted to say that it was it was pretty interesting where those fell because does that make sense yes it does and and it makes sense and it's something we're going to talk about shortly but hold on for that okay hold on for that thought just a moment. I also want to check and see if, because this intervention looked like it might have been closely tied into other things, so I want to see if there's any change in the issue of fun and joy in your life. And when you think of that value, you knew last night that there was 50% away from, you knew as we just working here today, that it was 80% away from. As you think of it right now, is there anything away from in that particular value? A little bit. Good. Good, good. Okay, good. But not like it was at all.
[1066.66 - 1067.10]  That's great.
[1067.56 - 1068.12]  That's perfect.
[1068.30 - 1083.40]  So here's what I'd like you to do. What I'd like you to do is I'd like you to pick a spot on the wall to look at. What I'd like you to do as you do that is just to allow your awareness to expand out into the peripheral. Got that? then I'd like you to consider fun and joy
[1083.40 - 1086.68]  as what's important to you about that.
[1088.68 - 1211.14]  And think about what is important to you about that. Yeah, and think about fun and joy as a value in your career. And notice if there's any shift in what you think about that. And what I'm doing as she's doing that is I'm standing here with my hand, moving it back and forth in her peripheral vision. And almost immediately when she went into the peripheral vision, Hakala state, and considered fun and joy, she got a smile on her face. Now the question, son, is, tell me when the away from component totally disappeared. It's gone. It's gone, okay. All right. Now, by the way, that looked rather simple, and the truth is that it was, but what I'd like to suggest is that the issue of success with regards to it being a family or genealogical issue probably would have been best cleared up using timeline therapy, from my point of view, but that once we'd handle any genealogical issue or anything like that, that it's going to be rather simple for us to do this using peripheral vision so that we bring that whole thing into alignment. So fun and joy is... Son, you look a little spaced. Very good. You're right in the right place. Okay, so we have just one more to look at, and that's the issue of your compensation or being paid well. So as you look at that now, what is the percentage of away from last night you said it was 60 right now this because we started this intervention you said it was 90. when you think of it right now what percentage is the issue paid from in terms of paid well i'm sorry in terms of being away from sun is sort of looking quizzically at her, values hierarchy and wondering.
[1211.14 - 1220.10]  Well, something's happening here.
[1220.10 - 1221.10]  Perfect.
[1221.10 - 1226.52]  But I don't know, I'm just kind of speechless.
[1226.52 - 1229.04]  Excellent. Why don't you pick a spot on the wall to focus on?
[1229.04 - 1245.78]  Thank you for watching. Perfect. And, but I, I don't know, I'm kind of speechless. Excellent. Why don't you pick a spot on the wall to focus on? And just go ahead and, as you pick that spot on the wall to focus on, just sort of allow your awareness to expand out in the peripheral. And then consider the value, the importance that you have of being paid well.
[1246.78 - 1249.18]  Son's smiling already.
[1254.14 - 1257.32]  And just stay in that state until whatever you knew was what was the away from component has disappeared.
[1258.62 - 1261.70]  One of the questions, by the way, that you may have to ask the client
[1261.70 - 1265.74]  as you do this, if you're just using the Hakalau or peripheral vision
[1265.74 - 1269.96]  as an intervention, is how do you know that that's an away from
[1269.96 - 1319.86]  Thank you. you may have to ask the client as you do this, if you're just using the Hakalau or peripheral vision as an intervention, is how do you know that that's an away from now? You may have to ask that specifically. We haven't had to ask that with Sun just yet, but if she doesn't access that immediately, we may have to ask that as a question. And then, Sun, when the away from is totally gone, you can just sort of come back. It's gone. Yeah. I just don't know what it was. Yeah, that's fine. So now, before you let go of both of those sets of away froms, I'd like to ask your unconscious mind to preserve whatever learnings there may have been necessary for you to get from this or whatever you needed to learn from this in such a way that will allow you in the future to be moving toward what you want in a way which is elegant and really positive that preserves your independence, it preserves your fun and joy, and your curiosity and anticipation.
[1405.94 - 1409.50]  Good. All right. Now, Sun, what we're going to do next is we're going to see if our interventions have made any difference to the hierarchy. And we're going to do that on wall chart number 21. So those of you listening on the tapes could turn to wall chart number 21. And Sun, what we're going to find out now is what the order and sequence of these values should be, what they ought to be in terms of the ranking of them. And we'll see if our prediction made any difference to see if the order and sequence of the values has actually changed without us doing a direct intervention into the values themselves so what's in the context of your career what if i what if like i'm going to change a number no no i don't want i i know you're going I know you want to change a number of them. What I'd like you to do is look at where they are right now. Oh, okay. And with simply those two interventions, because then what we'll do is we'll look at if we should change anything after that. And if they have changed, that's fine. But you need to tell me what they are right now not what you'd like oh right but what they really are right in
[1409.50 - 1447.64]  this minute so what's the number one value as you look at all of these values wait let me just do this let me take these numbers that were here and do that and we're looking at wall chart number 21 so you want me to tell you what they are now yeah well I don't think fun and joy are there okay well what's the what's the most important value results are curious results results okay what's the number two value
[1452.38 - 1458.26]  son is actually integrating while we talk to her so okay son what's the
[1458.26 - 1462.12]  number two value as you get a little perspective on this that I really love
[1462.12 - 1463.12]  Okay.
[1463.12 - 1464.12]  Oh, you want to read?
[1464.12 - 1465.12]  Please.
[1465.12 - 1466.12]  But I'm paid well.
[1466.12 - 1467.12]  All right.
[1467.12 - 1468.12]  Thank you.
[1468.12 - 1469.12]  Thank you.
[1469.12 - 1470.12]  Thank you.

[1484.12 - 1485.12]  Thank you.
[1485.12 - 1491.36]  Thank you. on this? That I really love what I do. Okay. Oh, you want three? Please. That I'm paid well. Uh-huh. That I'm creative. Creative, uh-huh. That I'm curious. See, I would think success should be important. However, if I'm getting the results, then I'm successful.
[1491.92 - 1495.78]  Oh, so success is a subset of results, then?
[1496.20 - 1499.28]  It seems to be. I mean, if I'm getting results.
[1501.76 - 1585.08]  I'll just sort of throw that in there like that. So, results slash success. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. That I'm challenged. That you're challenged. Is that what you said? Yeah. Okay, number six. I'm always connecting with people, so I don't think that needs to be there. I don't. Okay. Okay. So you're going to do that anyway? Yeah. Okay. What's next? Well, fun and joy, that's like a part of who I am. So I don't think that that needs to be there. Okay. I don't think independent needs to be there. Okay. Because I am. So I don't think that that needs to be there. I don't think independent needs to be there, because I am. What we're left with is? Satisfaction. And satisfaction, as long as I'm getting results and I'm successful, I'm really satisfied. So six for learning and growth. Seven? Oh, seven. Seven for learning and growth. And then satisfaction could be, I mean, satisfaction is important, but I believe that as I'm successful and I get results, I'm absolutely satisfied and fulfilled. So would it be results, success, satisfaction? Well, not one, two, three. No, but as part of. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So it could be results, which includes success and satisfaction.
[1585.22 - 1585.32]  Yes, yeah.
[1585.94 - 1586.22]  Okay.
[1586.76 - 1604.82]  And as I get results and I'm successful and satisfied and fulfilled, then I also have the respect. So that's just... So that's part of that, too. Okay. Funny it ended up being in there, too. Okay. So what do we have left, then? Connect with people. that's on these are all givens and so that's the order sequence of your value
[1604.82 - 1668.82]  so it would be results you really love what you do that you're paid well well excuse me we results which includes success and satisfaction and when you've got that you've got respect and then it would be you really love what you do that you're paid well that you're creative that you have curiosity and dissipation and a challenge and learning and growth I might just switch these because as I'm curious it makes me more oh wait yeah I just switched so that doesn't really matter you would switch those or you have switched them I guess I am switching them you are have switched them well let's so let's find out is so you wanted to switch which one, creative and curiosity, anticipation? Yeah, because as I'm curious and as I'm anticipating what's going to happen, that creates the creativity. So I have to be curious and anticipate first before the creativity really kicks in there. Okay, so let's find out. Okay. So if... So we'll find out. So if you could have, so I just want to know, I want to know what they are right now, not
[1668.82 - 1669.82]  what you're going to do.
[1669.82 - 1685.36]  Oh. In a moment. So if, yeah, so what we're looking for is where you're at right now. We haven't, we haven't not, we have not done an intervention into the order and sequence of the hierarchy yet. Okay. we've done indirect interventions which is to take away away from and we we may
[1685.36 - 1689.44]  do a parts integration if I hope I can demonstrate one with regards to a values
[1689.44 - 1685.28]  change have we? We've done indirect interventions, which is to take away away-froms, and we may
[1685.28 - 1702.74]  do a parts integration. I hope I can demonstrate one with regards to a values change. But where we're at right now is, so right now is being creative number four and curiosity and anticipation number five? Yes. Great. Okay. You say you may want to switch those. That would be fine. We'll show you how to do that. Okay. Okay, but that's the way they are right now.
[1703.26 - 1704.38]  This is the ordering sequence.
[1706.64 - 1707.00]  Right?
[1707.22 - 1707.90]  Feels like that.
[1707.92 - 1706.62]  Yeah, great. We'll show you how to do that. Okay. But that's the way they are right now. This is the ordering sequence.
[1706.98 - 1707.20]  Right?
[1707.90 - 1707.92]  Feels like that.
[1708.28 - 1711.80]  Yeah, great.
