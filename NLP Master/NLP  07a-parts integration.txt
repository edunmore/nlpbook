[0.00 - 29.60]  all right welcome back how did that exercise go yeah what did you did you notice that it was it was relatively easy to get to the same level of agreement yeah you notice that did you notice that it was relatively easy to separate intention from behavior with a conditional close yes but did you notice that it took a little more, did you notice it took actually quite a bit more skill to chunk down
[29.60 - 32.66]  as quickly as you can, all the while maintaining agreement?
[33.00 - 36.88]  Let me give you just one final piece to that, and then we'll move on.
[37.30 - 40.46]  The one final piece to that is, quite honestly,
[40.66 - 43.16]  if you get to a point where you chunk down
[43.16 - 65.80]  and the two people say no, they don't want to do it, then what you do is you go back to number two, to the conditional close again, and you go back to their highest level intention. So if at number three you don't actually, if you're not actually totally successful at getting them to do that, while maintaining agreement, then simply go back up to the specific word you were using before
[65.80 - 68.94]  and go back to the conditional close and then chunk back down again.
[69.86 - 70.00]  Yeah?
[73.16 - 74.96]  You could take it on a lateral chunk, yes.
[75.28 - 77.46]  The question is, if you're doing that because you're taking it on a lateral chunk,
[77.54 - 78.00]  yes, you could.
[78.60 - 81.86]  Since you're a master of chunking, and you are, are you not?
[82.80 - 405.38]  You're going to know exactly how to do that. All right. Any other questions? Excellent. All right. We're going to move on to talk about parts and I want to give you some additional theory which will, I think, assist your understanding of how prime concerns and how quantum linguistics work. Prime concerns is the first time I ever mentioned prime concerns. It's just an application of quantum linguistics, but we're moving toward that sort of directionally. So let's talk about parts and let's go to page 330. I'm also on slide number 49. What are parts? When I first took my master practitioner training, in fact, I asked the trainer, I said, what is a part? And the trainer went, shut up. It's like there was no really good answer for me, like what was a part in an LP. So hopefully this will answer the question. Let's talk a little bit about what is a part and how they might work. And by the way, this theoretical discussion will go actually across the board and allow us to look at a number of different angles with regards to parts and and also this applies to to every set of boundaries in the nervous system at the unconscious or conscious level okay so what we're talking about parts we could also be talking about anything else we've worked with so far. It'll become clear in a moment. Page 330. So parts, number one, parts are part of the unconscious mind, and they have generally a purpose or an intention, that's their highest level, and a lower level function or behavior. So each part will have a function or something that they do, a behavior, and each part will have a purpose or an intention. Parts are functionally detached from the rest of the nervous system. That is to say, they're essentially non-integrated with the rest of the nervous system. The way parts actually work is demonstrated on slide number 53. So, if you look at slide number 53, this is an example of the nervous system which is without parts. The entire, except for the part that says parts. But imagine that's not there. And what happens is, is that a significant emotional experience usually occurs. Something happens and a part actually is born. And that's on slide 54. So now we have a nervous system without boundaries, and what happens next is then we have a nervous system which has some boundaries to it, or added to it. And according to Dr. Paul Goodwin, trapped negative emotions can interfere in the body, can interfere with the flow of information through the neural network pathways. So a part or actually any kind of boundary conditions in the neural nets will actually interfere with the flow of information. So for example, if on slide number 55, if there was a piece of information that was supposed to flow from the, let's say, from the lower left through this part upward toward the upper right, and this piece of communication was supposed to then flow smoothly through, but if there was a part there through the activated set of neural networks, if there was a part there, the information might sort of go off awry or might not get to the place it was supposed to go. So the parts themselves tend to be functionally, functionally means software, detached from the rest of the nervous system. Page 330, they often represent, we could say, minor personalities or even significant others who we've modeled or who have been imprinted upon us. Usually they have their own set of values and belief systems, and some of them think they're in charge of the maintenance of the system. Parts are generally born from significant emotional experiences, just like in timeline therapy, any kind of gestalt might be. And they're usually to protect a non-integrated behavior. So a lot of times a part will protect and or continue actually a non-integrated behavior that a person produces. Parts can be a source of incongruency in the individual. And oftentimes, in fact, I haven't found one yet that wasn't. They themselves can be or are incongruent. And the incongruency usually lies in the difference between the purpose slash intention and the function slash behavior. Here's the thing. Think about it for a minute. A part which represents a part of the nervous system cannot possibly have the purpose or intention of the whole in mind. Right? It couldn't, because if it did, it wouldn't be a part. Okay? So epistemologically, that is to say, in terms of thinking about thinking, a part cannot possibly have the function or purpose of the whole in mind, because if it did, it would be the whole. So all we have to do is chunk the part up outside of its boundaries. So the difference usually lies in the incongruency, number 10, between the purpose slash intention and the function slash
[405.38 - 411.50]  behavior. Oftentimes, actually every time I've worked with a client, we found that a
[411.50 - 418.06]  part usually has its opposite number, an alter ego, flip side of the coin, another part with
[418.06 - 423.02]  which this part's most in conflict with. And these parts will usually have the same
[423.02 - 429.92]  highest purpose slash intention, usually will find that they were once part of a larger
[429.92 - 506.20]  We'll be right back. it. And these parts will usually have the same highest purpose slash intention. Usually we'll find that they were once part of a larger whole. And by the way, that's the way we would actually do reintegration. Let's look at page 331 at the bottom of our chart here. This chart starts at the bottom. If we have, we begin with the notion of wholeness. And my point of view is that we're born whole, W-H-O-L-E, and that life as it happens to us causes functional blockages to occur, and there are certain thresholds. Those horizontal lines on your chart, there are certain thresholds. So at some level, with no experience, we're whole. And then at some level, we can get gestalt, a limiting decision. There can be a negative state. Also, on the positive side, values, beliefs, and strategies are installed in the same way. Then there's another threshold, and we probably get a part a little more intense than that. It might be a compulsion. Somewhere in there would be a phobia. And at some point, when the part doesn't have any communication across the boundaries, we get a multiple personality. So my point of view is it's the same mechanics that create parts
[506.20 - 507.56]  that creates multiple personalities.
[508.30 - 510.54]  And what the difference is
[510.54 - 512.26]  is along the left-hand side of your diagram.
[512.38 - 513.84]  So let's look at what those three things are.
[515.72 - 517.68]  What affects the boundaries is,
[517.86 - 518.32]  first of all,
[518.36 - 520.12]  the number of times the event has happened.
[521.14 - 523.28]  So whether the boundaries are really high
[523.28 - 524.92]  and the information doesn't go through,
[585.84 - 607.64]  or whether the boundaries are really high and the information doesn't go through, or whether the boundaries are rather loose and pliable and the information does go through, depends on three things and they happen in the fourth. So the first is the number of times the event has happened. The second thing is the rate of change of the state. So if you can imagine a hill with a very gently sloping hill, that you'd be walking up this gently sloping hill, that's a slow rate of change of the state. And can you imagine walking up a hill that's like very, almost vertical in terms of how quickly you have to go up the hill? That's a rate of change of state that goes very quickly. Okay, so that's what I mean by the rate of change of the state. Some rates of change of state are too intense for the person to be able to traverse the boundaries easily. So a part is formed. The third thing is the intensity of the state. So think of a big hill, walking up a big hill versus walking up a little hill. Okay, that's the intensity of the state. That's the peak. That's how big it is. So the three things are the number of times, how many times this has happened, the rate of change, that is, is it a gentle slope up the hill or is it a tough walk up a very mountainous sort of hill?
[608.00 - 609.76]  And then how high is the peak?
[610.98 - 614.60]  And all of these happen, slide 58,
[614.74 - 616.42]  all of these happen in a nervous system
[616.42 - 618.80]  which is more or less flexible.
[619.28 - 622.02]  So the nervous system has more or less flexibility
[622.02 - 765.66]  as this particular state occurs in the individual. So that's what affects the boundaries. That's exactly what's going to affect the boundary conditions of the part as the boundary conditions are set up. Okay? So my point of view is that whether we're talking about, and I'm back to slide 56, my point of view is whether we're talking about strategies or beliefs or limiting decisions or negative states or parts or compulsions or phob, or multiple personalities, the mechanics in the nervous system are exactly the same. It's just a matter of intensity versus the peak versus the number of times. So that's why when we talked about going back and forth over the boundaries, remember we said, this is a part, what is the not part? We said, this is a chair, what is a not chair? As we were going back and forth over the boundaries last night when you're doing these exercises in quantum linguistics, the process was exactly the same. It's going back and forth over the boundaries. Now, what does a parts integration do? What does our standard parts integration do in NLP? Let's Let's look at page 332. Parts integration actually makes the person whole. That's what a parts integration does. So let's look and see here on page 332 exactly what we're going to be doing in our standard parts integration also called visual squash. Okay, so the first thing to do is identify the conflict and the parts involved. How many people, by the way, have not seen this particular script for this part? So this is the same as we did in the accelerated practitioner training, if you took your accelerated practitioner training with us. How many people have not seen this script? Great, okay. All right, so the first thing to do is to identify the conflict and the parts involved. The second thing we're going to do is we're going to have the part which represents the unwanted state or behavior to come out on the hand first. I'm going to demonstrate this in just a moment. Third thing we're going to do is have the opposite number or the flip side of the coin come out on the other hand. So we've got then two hands.
[769.04 - 769.16]  Third thing is to make sure that the client has a visual auditory,
[770.86 - 771.34]  it's like a VAK image of each part,
[777.36 - 780.22]  and we actually ask the client to personify the part as best we can.
[780.62 - 783.52]  Okay?
[865.42 - 867.46]  We ask the client to personify each part, and what I say to to the client usually is does that part look like anyone you know? Does it sound like anyone you know? As it sits in your hand, does it feel like anyone you know? Then we're going to separate intention from behavior. So we're going to reframe each part so they realize they actually have the same intention by chunking up. We're going to ask what is the intention or for what purpose? So we get each of the parts to the same place. And then we want to know what resources or attributes each part has that the other part would like to have. And then we have the parts notice they were once part of a larger whole. At that point, we can also ask for any other parts that were once part of the larger whole to join in the integration. Now let's think about this for just a minute. Let's go back to step number three. If we have parts which are neurologically very close together, in terms of the range of part and not part, if these parts are neurologically very close together, like, let's say, a part with which you're in conflict or a part with which you're not in conflict. Or, well, let me draw it out. Wall chart number 10. If this is the continuum, this horizontal line is a continuum from 0 to infinity, if we take two parts that are very close in that continuum, which would be marked X and X, then the integration will be that much. If, on the other hand, we take two parts that are very close in that continuum, which would be marked x and x, then the integration will be that much.
[867.46 - 872.34]  If on the other hand, we take two parts which would be marked y and y,
[872.34 - 876.76]  notice how much more integration we'll get if we get y and y.
[876.76 - 884.90]  So we're asking for the part that's the flip side of the coin.
[884.90 - 985.22]  The alternate number, the opposite number of the part that's out on the hand first. So we go for that opposite number to see if we can get the complete neurological integration to occur and what that will do is it will give the client a far more profound experience of that integration occurring. The client will have a very, very profound integration of that experience occurring if the parts are widely divergent, if the parts are way divergent in terms of their neurological separateness. Okay, then we do a VAK image of each part because we want to personify it or really hook the client into or have the client really light up the neural networks. We want those neural networks really lit up when we do this. Then we're going to separate intention from behavior. And at some point, by the way, when we get the part to the same word, the hands will start coming together automatically. If you do the parts integration really, really, really, really well, the hands will start coming together automatically. Some of you have already experienced that. You may have seen me do that before. I'm going to do a demonstration here before we actually do the exercise so you'll get a chance to see it. But what we're looking for is if the parts are like, for example, we've got them, the AK image, and once we have both of those parts really there, if when we get to the same word, if the hands start coming together, you don't have to go down this whole list. Just tell the client, allow the hands to continue to come together. But if the hands do not come together, we've got step number six. So if
[985.22 - 1007.98]  the hands don't come together, we're going to create a third part with a combined resources of each part. We're going to place the third image between the other two images. We're going to create a series of visual images representing the metamorphosis or transition from each part to the central image. Step number seven, we're going to then bring the hands together. If the hands start coming together at step number five, you'll jump down to step number seven. We're going to
[1007.98 - 1188.38]  bring the hands together and If the hands start coming together at step number five, you'll jump down to step number seven. We're going to bring the hands together and at the same time have the individual images begin to merge. Then step number eight, we're going to take the integrated part inside. And step number nine is optional. And it's in relationship, if you've done this in relationship to timeline therapy, that is if in the middle of releasing a negative emotion you came to do a parts integration, then you would do step number 9 and 11. If you didn't, you wouldn't. Oftentimes you'll have to do a parts integration before the negative emotion will fully release. So if you came out of timeline therapy to this point, you'll use step number 9. For this exercise, we probably won't be coming out of timeline therapy. In fact, I'm sure of it. Step number ten is to test in future pace. And then step number eleven, if you came out of timeline therapy and did step number nine, then you'll take the new super part in the timeline and you'll release any event or any decision from the past relative to the presenting problem. Okay? So that's what we're going to do and I'd like to demonstrate this right now. Okay, so I want to do a demonstration but first I want to give you some more information because we want to add on to the parts integration that you learned, this parts integration that we just went through. I want to add on to that and go through some additional information about parts integration so that when I do the demonstration, I can also do some linguistic stuff with the integration of the parts. Let's do some additional considerations first. This is on slide number 59, but it's not in your notes. Just a couple of things with regards to information being transmitted through neural networks. The frequency of the wave of the energy determines the meaning of the sensation. That's a, that's a notion from, that's a notion from quantum physics and from quantum biology, that the frequency of the waveform through the neuron, the frequency of the waveform, the frequency of the wave, in other words, like a radio station, the low frequency versus the higher frequency, the frequency determines the meaning of the sensation. So essentially, a sensation in your body is just frequency. We'll see how this all integrates here in just a minute. Number two, the information can flow in multiple directions and dimensions. This is also information that's important in the creation of a part. And the third thing is that we can actually make a mountain out of a molehill, which is to say that a somewhat minor event can often get blown up into a major event, and even that can become a part. So all of these things determine whether a part will be a part, or even if it goes more intensely, whether it will be a multiple personality, or if it goes less intensely, whether it will be simply a negative motion or a limiting decision. Okay, so these are three additional, I would say probably not major considerations like
[1188.38 - 1191.58]  the other ones that we talked about.
[1191.58 - 1249.16]  But nevertheless, they are considerations. It is possible to integrate parts linguistically without actually doing a parts integration. So we're going to see what happens, and I'd like to demonstrate perhaps both, or one, or we'll see, we'll see where we get to. It is possible to integrate parts linguistically. And so we'll go back to the notion that a part has a purpose, we're looking at slide number 65 now, that a part has a purpose and a behavior. So each part you work with will have a purpose, or an intention, and some behavior that it's producing. And if you swap swap the behavior you actually can integrate the
[1249.16 - 1255.00]  parts sometimes but not always and it depends on how intense their boundaries
[1255.00 - 1260.38]  are but there is a linguistic parts integration handout that you have in
[1260.38 - 1263.52]  your linguistics section so we got to go back from section 3 back to section 2
[1263.52 - 1269.94]  now and it's on page 247 section 2 page 47 it is possible to integrate parts
[1269.94 - 1285.62]  I'll see you do it. The first thing is you discover the function or behavior for each part, and you want to know what's the behavior of the part or what is the function the part plays.
[1304.78 - 1305.88]  And the second thing you want to do is discover the purpose or intention of the behavior. So what is the purpose of this behavior? What's the intent of the behavior? You want to make sure the learnings are present. The third thing is you want to make sure that the learnings are present. So you can ask, what is there to learn from this behavior? You want to handle the ecology, the integration.
[1308.16 - 1370.62]  And then you're simply going to switch the purpose or intention from one part to the other. You'll simply switch the purpose or intention from one part to the other and notice if it integrates. Now, notice the difference between this process and notice what happens when we do it. So now I'd like to have a volunteer and we'll see what we demonstrate. Because now that I can get to play with the linguistics, we'll see exactly what we're demonstrating, whether we're demonstrating a standard parts integration or whether we're demonstrating a linguistic parts integration. So what's the conflict? Yeah. So you seem to be doing things which injure you. And what? You seem to be doing things which injure yourself and you think there's some self-punishment there. But how does that relate to a part? So you feel there's a part of you that does it. Okay, good. Come on up. Give her a hand. All right, so let's see. Yvonne, you have a part of you that you feel is what?
[1370.62 - 1373.78]  Can you tell me what's going on?
[1374.46 - 1379.20]  Well, it seems that if I go to do something that I get enjoyment out of,
[1379.50 - 1383.68]  I either injure myself so that I can't participate properly
[1383.68 - 1385.92]  or I get sick
[1385.92 - 1387.64]  afterwards as if it was a sort of
[1387.64 - 1389.80]  punishment for injuring myself.
[1390.30 - 1391.44]  Really? Yeah.
[1394.80 - 1395.36]  Okay.
[1396.34 - 1398.14]  And you think there's a part of you that's
[1398.14 - 1399.86]  causing this or what? What do you think?
[1400.80 - 1402.12]  Yeah, because I always say
[1402.12 - 1404.02]  there's a part of me that thinks I need punishing.
[1404.44 - 1404.70]  Really?
[1406.78 - 1407.26]  That's great.
[1407.32 - 1446.38]  I wonder if I could talk to that part. Yeah. Could I? Yeah. I wonder which hand that part would like to come out and stand on. Would it like to come out and stand on the right hand? Oh, it would. Okay. Let's see. Would that part like to come out stand here or here? I know if you, right there. Okay, great. Now, as that part is there, does that part look like anyone you know? My mother. Looks like your mother. Whoa, okay. Does it sound like your mother? Yes. It does, okay. And of course that part has a certain weight or feels a certain way, right?
[1447.48 - 1447.80]  Yes.
[1447.98 - 1449.16]  Now, I wonder if there's a part
[1449.16 - 1451.58]  with which that part is most in conflict.
[1451.94 - 1454.48]  The flip side of the coin, the alter ego, if you will.
[1456.02 - 1456.88]  There is another part.
[1457.02 - 1458.14]  I wonder if that part would like to come out
[1458.14 - 1459.06]  and stand on the other hand, would it?
[1459.16 - 1460.44]  If it would come and stand...
[1460.44 - 1485.32]  Would it like to stand here? Yeah, right there. Okay, great. So what does that part look like? Me. Looks like you. A younger me. A younger you. Okay. Now what's this part's intention for this behavior? To stop me from doing things.
[1485.54 - 1487.24]  To stop you from doing things.
[1489.32 - 1492.20]  And, let's see,
[1492.40 - 1496.16]  what's this part's intention?
[1498.02 - 1499.54]  To enjoy things.
[1500.54 - 1502.12]  Okay, now let's just see.
[1503.22 - 1504.24]  This part here.
[1527.50 - 1529.16]  What's this part's highest intention for stopping you from doing things? To stop me getting hurt. To stop you getting hurt. Well, that's interesting. Because I wonder if that part realizes that it... Because the part is the part
[1529.16 - 1530.42]  that's creating the behavior of getting hurt,
[1530.52 - 1531.16]  so the purpose...
[1531.16 - 1532.12]  Oh, wait, I don't understand this.
[1532.24 - 1534.78]  The purpose is to stop you from getting hurt,
[1534.88 - 1535.94]  so it's creating you getting hurt.
[1539.26 - 1540.10]  Emotional hurt.
[1540.76 - 1541.60]  I wonder if...
[1541.60 - 1543.50]  Well, I don't get it.
[1543.54 - 1544.86]  So the part's to stop you from getting hurt,
[1544.92 - 1585.40]  so it's hurting you, right? Wow. Does it get that it's behavior and it's conflict, behavior and it's intention are in the, should we say in conflict? Does it notice that there's a conflict there? No. It doesn't. Okay. So does it figure then that it needs to... I don't understand. Like, for example, if it was going to stop you from being hurt, what would be the purpose in that? Stop rejection.
[1586.18 - 1588.88]  For what purpose?
[1590.42 - 1590.82]  Stop emotional pain.
[1591.42 - 1597.48]  For what purpose?
[1598.84 - 1599.18]  Stop feeling hurt.
[1599.84 - 1601.94]  For what purpose?
[1604.34 - 1605.78]  Now, notice that we're getting right up at the limits of the boundaries here.
[1606.60 - 1607.36]  Are you with me?
[1607.54 - 1607.70]  Yeah.
[1608.26 - 1608.46]  Okay.
[1609.84 - 1611.14]  So what would be the purpose in that?
[1614.96 - 1615.96]  To be happy.
[1616.38 - 1616.94]  To be happy.
[1617.90 - 1618.34]  Whoa.
[1619.04 - 1619.48]  Cool.
[1619.52 - 1620.78]  Now, what's this part's purpose over here?
[1621.40 - 1622.14]  To have fun.
[1626.00 - 1626.86]  For what purpose?
[1629.68 - 1626.86] 
[1645.78 - 1648.66]  Thank you for watching. purpose over here? To have fun. For what purpose? Enjoyment. To be happy. That's interesting, isn't it? These parts, did they notice they have the same highest intention? I mean, did they, could they think that they had the same highest intention?
[1649.50 - 1651.18]  I do now.
[1653.80 - 1654.30]  That's sort of a surprise to them, isn't it, when they think about it?
[1654.66 - 1658.86]  Isn't it?
[1661.42 - 1663.84]  In fact, could they notice, were they once part of a larger whole?
[1664.70 - 1666.46]  They were, weren't they? Were there any other parts that were once part of a larger whole? They were, weren't they?
[1668.84 - 1670.68]  Were there any other parts that were once part of that larger whole?
[1671.24 - 1671.96]  They were.
[1674.28 - 1675.20]  I wonder, as these two parts look at each other,
[1677.06 - 1695.44]  could you have them sort of look at each other and notice what's the positive attributes that each part has that the other would like to have?
[1695.44 - 1700.84]  There's quite a good integration going on there, isn't there?
[1700.84 - 1701.84]  Because I think your hands are shaking.
[1701.84 - 1702.84]  I think so, too.
[1702.84 - 1703.84]  You think so, too?
[1703.84 - 1709.84]  In fact, I don't know if you noticed this, but they've moved just a little bit closer.
[1709.84 - 1787.08]  Thank you. Because I think your hands are shaking. I think so, too. You think so, too? In fact, I don't know if you noticed this, but they've moved just a little bit closer. Did you notice that? You did? Huh. They're not going to continue to move. But the other parts here, if the other parts, if they wanted to come and join in, perhaps they could notice how they'd want to best integrate at the unconscious level. So there's this part here, this part here has attributes that this part would like to have, right? It does, does it not? And this part here has attributes that this part would like to have. Some. Yeah, certainly not all of them. And this part here has attributes that this part, each of the parts has attributes the other part would like to have, doesn't it? Yep. Huh. They feel heavy. They feel heavy, yeah. But notice that they are moving together, aren't they? I wonder if you'd just like to allow them to continue to go ahead and do that as the two parts just sort of come together and whatever other parts were once part of that larger whole. And what I'm going to suggest is that as they come together, you allow all of whatever neural networks were not whole and complete together.
[1788.46 - 1790.54]  That you just simply allow them
[1790.54 - 1792.52]  to just sort of open up and be totally integrated.
[1796.46 - 1799.00]  That's good, because there's a lot of energy right there, isn't there?
[1802.66 - 1803.82]  That's really good.
[1825.18 - 1826.08]  Because these parts have been apart for a long time. But now they really want to come together, don't they? They do, don't they? Yeah, that's really magnificent. So just allow that to continue. That's right.
[1828.58 - 1830.16]  And don't allow them to touch
[1830.16 - 1834.80]  until they're absolutely ready to integrate.
[1836.98 - 1839.04]  Totally and completely at the unconscious level.
[1840.30 - 1843.02]  Right now.
[1845.36 - 1846.08]  That's right.
[1852.32 - 1853.56]  Now what Yvonne is noticing
[1853.56 - 1854.78]  is a tremendous amount of energy
[1854.78 - 1856.06]  being released from this process.
[1857.94 - 1858.90]  Are you noticing that?
[1859.30 - 1859.50]  Yeah.
[1860.04 - 1860.62]  Okay, just checking.
[1864.24 - 2006.96]  That's good, Yvonne. Just allow that integrated part now to just sort of come inside. So just take that part right inside and just allow it to go right inside and become totally one and totally integrated with all the rest of your unconscious mind at the unconscious level. Just allow it to totally integrate the unconscious level. That's good, Yvonne hot that's what I that's what I would have said those are power surges no but think about it for a minute our theory of parts that we just talked about there's a trapped energy in the part that is part of the neurological constraints. And what we do is we, on wall chart number 10, we go for the widest possible separation, which means we're going to get the opposite number. So like, in terms of a battery, what has the most charge? A little negative or a whole lot negative all the way over from positive? Well, obviously, a whole lot negative all the way over from positive. So what Yvonne has done is she's taken two opposite charges electrically. That's what I mentioned earlier about the electrical charge, that the information transferred through the neurons is electrical. When we've got trapped information in there, it feels to me like there's trapped energy. Now, that may not be a really solid description in terms of science, but it feels to me like there's trapped energy in there. And when we integrate two parts that are so widely neurologically divergent, all of that trapped energy gets freed up, and the client feels it in their body. My migraine's gone. Your migraine's gone. I had it for two days. You had a migraine for two days, and now it's gone. Excellent. Excellent. Yvonne, that's something you... It's like me. I'm very forgetful. You know, I used to worry about my memory, and then I forgot to. It's like with the... Whatever you know, whatever that thing was, you can just let it go now. Because whatever was, part of that isn't anymore. It's all integrated. So as you think about your future, you can certainly have your head be comfortable, right? Yep. Good. Welcome back. Thank you. How was that? Good.
[2007.90 - 2008.14]  Welcome back.
[2008.58 - 2008.78]  Thank you.
[2009.34 - 2009.80]  How was that?
[2010.22 - 2011.70]  Good.
[2012.88 - 2015.28]  I'm exhausted now.
[2016.20 - 2016.70]  Give her a hand.
[2017.00 - 2018.36]  Thank you.
[2021.80 - 2022.58]  So that was a demonstration of our standard parts integration.
[2045.00 - 2046.16]  Pretty straightforward, based on the script on page 332. Any questions about that? No? Absolutely standard parts integration. Okay, so let's do this as an exercise. Let's do the standard parts integration as an exercise. Okay, so why don't you get together groups of three people, a practitioner client and observer master practitioners
[2046.16 - 2046.54]  will get together
[2046.54 - 2047.40]  do parts integration
[2047.40 - 2048.40]  with the other person
[2048.40 - 2049.62]  following the outline
[2049.62 - 2050.34]  on page 332
[2050.34 - 2051.36]  if you're listening
[2051.36 - 2051.78]  to the tapes
[2051.78 - 2052.68]  please stop the tapes
[2052.68 - 2053.72]  and do the exercise now
[2053.72 - 2055.10]  go ahead and stop the tapes now
[2055.10 - 2060.24]  this is the end of tape 7
[2060.24 - 2061.38]  side A
