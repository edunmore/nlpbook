[0.00 - 146.00]  What we're going to demonstrate next is how to shift the values in a hierarchy because Sun has identified something that she'd like to do. And we've gotten to this point, and this is the point where we would actually make a shift in the values hierarchy. Once we've done the cleanup, we've handled the away froms. Oh, a couple questions that we might ask ourselves. One of the questions we might ask ourselves is, why was success so low on the values hierarchy? Why did it shift upward when we got rid of the away-from component of it? Essentially, what she had was her whole life looked at her dad and had an image of success of that. When we let go of the limiting decision and the negative emotions that were around that, what it allowed success to be was her own, let's say, definition of it. So surprisingly, success moved up in the hierarchy, which is perfect, because then it sort of aligned itself or became part of the issue of results and also satisfaction, which brings respect. So notice also that for Sun, that having a significant or really high away-from component in these cases kept the values, or kept her focusing on the negative, which kept them at a lower level. This is, I think, also predictable with regards to compensation or money or income, in that a client who moves strongly away from a role model when we get rid of the, in terms of what the effect was on the person's life is going to have money or compensation or income be lower on the values hierarchy than when they let go of them. Okay, so what I'd like to do next is to simply, what we're going to do now is demonstrate the shift of the curiosity and anticipation so that it is more important than being creative. Okay? Because Sun said that she wanted to shift that. Alright? So that's what we're going to do. So Sun, when you think of, in your values hierarchy right now, when you think of the issue of being paid well, so what we're doing, what are we doing? Well, let me just stop for a moment. And what we're doing is slide 149, or in your notebook, page 327. And let's use 327 as an example. What we're going to do for sun is we're going to find the submodalities
[146.00 - 152.00]  of the higher level value that we want to move the lower level value up below.
[152.00 - 156.00]  Then we're going to shift the submodalities of the lower level value
[156.00 - 159.00]  to very close to those of the higher level value,
[159.00 - 162.00]  and notice where it settles out.
[162.00 - 164.00]  Okay, that's, that's exactly what we're going to do.
[164.00 - 205.70]  So we're going to do a submodality shift. In order to change values in a hierarchy, you don't need to do that. You don't need to do it all at once. That is to say, you don't need to elicit all of the relative values of the submodalities, of all the relative values. You don't need to find out which submodalities end up causing the values to be in a hierarchy. You only simply need to elicit the higher level value that you want to move the next, the lower level value up underneath. And so, since she wants to move number 5 to just below number 3, we're going to elicit number 3, right? And then what that'll do is it'll end up moving number
[205.70 - 224.52]  five to number three. Okay? Let's, let's, we'll just do that. This'll take but a moment. So Sun, when you, in the context of your career, when you think of being paid well, do you have a picture? And that picture represents the value or the importance of being paid well, does it not? Is that in black and white or color?
[224.52 - 225.52]  Color.
[225.52 - 245.10]  Is it near or far? Out in the middle of the room. In the middle of the room, okay. It's very big. Very big. Do you see yourself in the picture? I kind of flip back and forth. I see both. I'm in the picture,
[245.18 - 247.94]  I'm out of the picture, and I'm in the picture, I'm out of the picture. So when you're out
[247.94 - 306.40]  of the picture, are you looking through your own eyes? When I'm out of the picture? Yeah. In other words, are you flipping back and forth between associated and disassociated? Yes. Okay. Is it a movie or still? It's a movie. Is it bright or dim? It's bright. Actually, it's not that bright no it's kind's kind of a beam? Okay. Can you clear the screen? Great. What I'd like you to do is to go ahead and get that picture up on the screen and have it be the picture which represents for you the importance of curiosity and anticipation, the value of curiosity and anticipation in the context of your career. Make sure it's that one. Yeah? And what I'd like you to do is to make it the same color as the previous picture
[306.40 - 306.98]  of being paid well.
[309.24 - 311.30]  Have it be in the middle of the room,
[311.44 - 312.80]  but just a little farther out.
[314.72 - 317.34]  Like, just a little farther out.
[318.44 - 318.66]  Okay?
[319.00 - 321.22]  And have it be back and forth
[321.22 - 322.64]  between associated and dissociated.
[324.48 - 365.74]  And have it be a movie. and have it be of medium brightness. Okay, and then you know the sound that Tupperware makes when it seals. Sun's nodding yes all the time, by the way. You know the sound Tupperware makes when it seals, right? Just lock it right in there. Great. Then go ahead and clear the screen? All right. Welcome back. Nice day. It's so much nicer than this morning. It's terrible. Well, you had a great revelation. I'm so much in favor of great revelations. Me too. I'm not going to tell you that I'm sorry that you had a great revelation.
[366.76 - 367.62]  Good, good.
[368.16 - 369.56]  Okay, let's see.
[370.28 - 373.24]  So when you look at these values, which is more important to you,
[374.52 - 376.10]  curiosity and anticipation or being creative?
[379.40 - 379.76]  Curiosity.
[381.20 - 383.32]  Oh, so curiosity is more important than being creative.
[383.32 - 385.96]  So would you, as we were to re-look at them one more time,
[405.88 - 406.88]  then would you say that curiosity is number four? Being creative is number five. Let's just see. Can you actually go through and tell me what's the number one value in that hierarchy there? Results. Okay, good. That can do it. What's two? Really loving what I do. What's three? To look. Yes. Oh, being paid well.
[406.88 - 407.88]  Yes.
[407.88 - 408.94]  Do you want me to not look?
[408.94 - 409.94]  No.
[409.94 - 447.88]  Oh, okay. And what's four? Curiosity. Good. What's five? Creative. Great. Great. Being challenged and learning. Excellent. So for me, that looks pretty congruent. What I would do is give her another day. Since I knew that she had something shake out in the overnight, if I were doing a personal breakthrough session I'd schedule some time with her tomorrow just to make sure that these values, that there were no other revelations that she needed to have or anything like that. But what we now have is a hierarchy that's more to her liking, I mean, I hesitate to say this, but
[447.88 - 452.38]  since we're all done, since results is one of my high values, I'm, I'm not
[452.38 - 458.14]  displeased with the outcome. But I hope I didn't have anything to do with the
[458.14 - 462.02]  process of it getting there. So, all right. Thank you, Sun. Please give her a hand.
[462.02 - 487.20]  Thank you. Good job. All right, thank you, son. Please give her a hand. Thank you. Good job. All right, let's take some questions on what we just saw. I noticed when you did the submodality change, you only used the visual submodalities, and I know there's a reason, but I'm asking what it was. The reason was, and probably when you do this yourself, with clients, the first few you ought to ask, are there any, are there any sounds that are important or any
[487.20 - 545.50]  feelings that are important? I'm sort of a minimalist, I have to admit. And I like to get stuff done as quickly as possible. So if I had shifted the values and the values had not changed relatively in the hierarchy then I would have gone back and gathered more information. That would have been interesting. to use the visuals because I felt like the values were going to be, I felt like the hierarchy was going to be visual. And I intuitively felt like, it's funny I'm using kinesthetic to describe that, I intuitively felt like that distance was the thing that was going to make it, I felt like distance was what was going to make it more important or less important. so I had to put it further, a little bit further out and that seemed to do the trick. Distance is often, distance or location up to down is often, those two are often like major ways that we hierarchy stuff. Since values are generally a VKcase anesthesia, I felt like I didn't
[545.50 - 567.52]  need to worry about auditory kinesthetic. But I have had clients with whom I did have to, but being the minimalist that I am, I didn't enter, I didn't elicit any more than I needed to. And if I got, see, NLP is so, I mean, the way we do these things, it's so quick that, so what, if you don't get it the first time, you go back and elicit more information and you do it, you get it the second time, right? Okay, other questions
[567.52 - 585.52]  about what we just saw? On one of Sun's values, you use the Hakalau intervention, and you, I guess, target it for part of her awareness on that value, and for that intervention, don't you have the chance of actually blowing it all out?
[585.80 - 586.26]  Yes.
[588.28 - 588.80]  Okay. Was that your purpose?
[589.08 - 589.28]  No.
[589.88 - 590.32]  Oh, okay.
[593.64 - 594.32]  And I thought we would do what we did and notice what we noticed.
[598.04 - 599.20]  In fact, as I look at the hierarchy, I think that will produce better results for her.
[665.38 - 666.34]  And the truth is that you do run the risk of blowing out all the away-froms, which would be interesting. Depending on how you do it, it's possible that you could blow out all the away-froms. It's possible you could certainly change the values, the toward values and their relative importance to the point where they were either unconsciously accepted. See, what Sun said with some of the values that shifted out was she said, that's who I am. So they shifted from being in the context of her career to the context of her being. So some of the values expanded the context, which is, I think, going to have her be more clear in her own mind about what she wants. So with the peripheral vision intervention, you do run the risk of context, which is why you probably ought to be, you probably ought to look at what you're doing as you do it and make sure that you've contextualized it tightly and know that it will probably go outside of context anyway. Okay, other questions? Yes. That's who I am.
[666.46 - 686.40]  Does that mean anything that we feel that's who we are does not need to be in the values? No, it doesn't. If it came up, if the client says it as part of the values, then it's part of the values, regardless of what comment they make. So what you're doing is you're taking her experience and making it yours. and what I would say is just look at each client individually
[686.40 - 725.14]  and don't make a generalization if you've elicited one client's values and they say that's who I am. A lot of times the way values work is if a client feels that something's handled, it's not going to be part of what's important to them. To put it another way, if you really feel like you've got this as a given, it may not be part of your values hierarchy. Now, it may really be part of your values hierarchy, but you may not mention it in a single intervention. That doesn't seem to make, that doesn't seem to,
[726.36 - 727.32]  it doesn't seem to reduce
[727.32 - 727.82]  the effectiveness
[727.82 - 728.68]  of the intervention.
[729.58 - 730.60]  What Sun's going to find out
[730.60 - 731.88]  from this values hierarchy here
[731.88 - 733.20]  is that she's probably going to
[733.20 - 734.86]  get quite a bit better results,
[735.00 - 735.74]  be more successful,
[735.92 - 736.78]  and make a lot more money
[736.78 - 737.96]  and really enjoy it.
[738.70 - 739.78]  I think that's probably
[739.78 - 740.58]  what you'll find out
[740.58 - 742.62]  from this particular
[742.62 - 743.40]  values hierarchy.
[744.60 - 845.64]  And a lot of things, some of the things that she had where they were away from, by the way, each of those things that dropped out of her hierarchy had also some away from component, which may have had a higher away from component than she was aware of consciously. So when those dropped out, like to me, for example, if I could analyze a little bit, the issue of independence has got to have an away from component to it, which is at least a percentage higher than what she said, which was a little bit. To me, the word independence implies that there's got to be some away from component. Because independence from what? To me, what's the comparative? So independence from something. So what happened with that value was that the away from component disappeared. And probably that's more beneficial to her anyway, because if independence is not an issue, then she's going to be focusing on more important things. Right? So anyway, if a client says that's who I am, who I am it doesn't mean that the words don't have to be in the hierarchy. You have to ask the client and calibrate on what the client tells you. So I wouldn't make any hard, fast rule about that. Other questions? Hi Laura, how are you? In transition. So what I used on the last exercise to elicit my motivation driver was rejection and when we redid the values list that's my number one value and what i heard you say is you've never changed a client's number one value directly and that's my goal so tell me. Directly. So we're going to do it indirectly.
[846.02 - 847.08]  Yeah, indirectly means,
[847.66 - 849.72]  see, I wouldn't go in and do a
[849.72 - 853.02]  submodalities intervention on your value.
[853.50 - 855.94]  I wouldn't go in and do a direct intervention
[855.94 - 857.06]  on your number one value.
[857.52 - 858.84]  But if we got rid of the,
[858.94 - 860.92]  if your number one value was primarily away from
[860.92 - 862.52]  and we got rid of the away froms,
[863.30 - 905.80]  and then your number one value changed, that would be fine with me. Okay. So, if we got rid of all the away froms, your number one value probably would not be your number one value. Because it'd either disappear or rearrange. It would disappear or rearrange, right. Cool. Or, or the positive or greater context, greater contextual expression of that value, that is, the same expression of that value in a bigger context, might become more important, or might be important. More positive, not necessarily. Also more positive if we take, also totally positive, or more positive if we take out the away froms, right? Excuse me, I'm in an altered state. Yes, you are in Hawaii, and you're doing just fine. When you perform your intervention,
[906.44 - 908.28]  do you usually get the type of integration
[908.28 - 913.74]  where success means results and respect means results,
[915.72 - 918.00]  whereas you don't get an integration
[918.00 - 919.88]  with creativity and results?
[920.56 - 922.50]  Do you usually? No, there's no usual.
[923.06 - 924.68]  You just have to look and see what the client says.
[924.76 - 1028.40]  Or is that normal? Every time you do an intervention with a client, it will be different. There's no way that you can take one experience and generalize it to all clients. Every time I've done a values intervention, it has been different, as we'll see in just a bit because we want to go over some additional values. I want to demonstrate some additional values of intervention, but every time you do a values intervention, my experience is it'll be different. And so there's no hard and fast rule we can say that this happens and this happens. Sun groups success, satisfaction, and therefore respect as subsets of results, which to my way of thinking is possible to do. And just because creative didn't go in there doesn't mean that there's anything wrong, it just didn't. And that she wanted to shift curiosity and anticipation, that's fine because curiosity and anticipation was a little bit higher before and then it sort of dropped down, which is also possible when you take out an away from component. You were wondering if there was something you missed. There was nothing you missed, and there's no rule of thumb that we can make from what we just saw in terms of what they will normally do. That was just me eliciting what happened to her when we went back afterward and found out where they all settled out. And, of course, we did have shift in our hierarchy, didn't we, Patrick? Yes, we did. Changing creativity and curiosity, if there was bigger spread, would there have been anything you would have done different, like if curiosity was way down the ladder and she wanted to bring it up to like third or something? No, the intervention I demonstrated is exactly what I would do, and exactly what I have done every time I've shifted values
[1028.40 - 1046.00]  in the hierarchy using submodality shift. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. I mean, that is the way to do it, exactly as we did it. Regardless of the shift, you simply elicit the higher level value. So I elicited, in this case, I elicited number three for her, as you remember, and we got the submodalities of number three, and
[1046.00 - 1045.84]  then we changed the submodalities of number three,
[1045.98 - 1048.32]  and then we changed the submodalities of number five
[1048.32 - 1051.70]  into the number three, backing off one of them,
[1051.78 - 1054.90]  which I felt was the driver, or one of the drivers.
[1055.30 - 1056.48]  So I backed it off slightly.
[1056.82 - 1058.18]  Well, actually, I did, didn't I? I backed it off.
[1058.40 - 1059.70]  I mean, I did more than just backing it off.
[1059.74 - 1060.98]  I backed it off from her.
[1061.90 - 1063.54]  And then...
[1063.54 - 1229.70]  Right? it off from her and then right okay and then and then it ended up and then it ended up being number four so that even even if we were going like to shift it to number one I would have elicited number one change it to these seven dollars number one and then backed off one of the drivers or what I felt was a driver yeah okay Linda yes in the exercise when she said that those were her qualities of herself in the demonstration in the demonstration yeah when you think of the six areas they encompass a personality so would there be a hierarchy of of your being that is even higher than these six areas and that it transcends all the others, kind of, sort of? Well, of course, there probably is a... There probably is a higher level than this, even. The psychology of the ancient Hawaiians talked about something more than the unconscious mind and the conscious mind, which we call a higher self or a higher conscious mind. And it's possible that, and yes, it's possible that there's a higher level of self. The issue for me is that with regards to our NLP interventions, we need to get to a sufficient level of specificity. So the temptation is to go to the bigger level and handle it all there because you want to shortcut the time. The problem is if you don't handle it specifically enough, then the issues that generated the problems won't be resolved. So in many ways you need to get specific enough so that the intervention lights up the neural networks and that the client themselves, that we have enough specificity to make the change in the given area. Well, it starts to seem, just hearing now, that if we're working in the specific areas of how we're dealing with life outside, which is business, relationship, family, spirituality, all of the six areas, then there starts to be an integration of who we, in a sense, we are consciously, that this is bringing the conscious awareness of who we are, and that we can sometimes get rid of some of these, like we make a list of 20 and it comes down to 10 because we've integrated those parts are really part of other parts already so the specifically the being specific in those areas brings more unity of our conscious knowledge of the qualities that are already there the values that are already there and that they're integrated so i would resist if i were you the temptation to collapse all your values into one, which I think is what
[1229.70 - 1288.50]  you're leading to. I would resist that temptation because, in essence, that would be the way for someone who is enlightened, and you might find that all motivation disappears. That's one of the interventions I did with a guy, remember, who earlier I told you wanted to be enlightened. We did collapse all of his values into one, and he did lose all motivation to work for about six months. So if you do that with a client, the results may be unpredictable. I would say that you probably ought to stay specific enough when you're doing this so as to hold the context, so as to stay inside the context that you're working with will give you predictable results. And so my caveat to you is as follows. If a client comes to you for a business problem and then quits his job and goes to India and meditates for the next 20 years, you will not get a lot of clients for business problems.
[1291.26 - 1291.38]  And the results for the client may also be unpredictable.
[1292.20 - 1292.30]  Now, if the client comes to you and says,
[1293.06 - 1294.00]  I want to be enlightened,
[1295.52 - 1296.52]  then I think that's appropriate.
[1299.30 - 1300.00]  Now, whether or not we've done the right thing for the client is a different issue.
[1300.10 - 1302.36]  Whether or not this is what the client should have had
[1302.36 - 1303.62]  is a different issue.
[1304.24 - 1307.24]  But I don't know that I have a right to say,
[1307.36 - 1308.98]  oh, you're not enlightened and you should be,
[1309.86 - 1312.28]  therefore I'm going to blow all context for you
[1312.28 - 1312.98]  without telling you.
[1313.04 - 1314.36]  I think that would be inappropriate.
[1314.92 - 1317.40]  Because you may not get the learnings
[1317.40 - 1319.84]  that you need to get interimly.
[1321.90 - 1466.46]  So if you get the present state, remember our little diagram on page 5-1, if you get the present state, remember our little diagram on page 5-1, if you get the present state and then you find that the client chunks up to a bigger context during the intervention, that is demonstrative of an inductive process of change having occurred. Okay, that demonstrates that the neurologic, remember we talked the first day about neurological boundaries, that demonstrates that the neurological boundaries which were present on the condition of the problem that we've actually gone beyond those all I'm saying is that if because Linda where you're leading toward is let's blow it all out and thinking how beautiful this gently puts the person into more congruence season puts the parts more together. And then that way that they get a more sense of self consciously for a change and then can take it to all the areas of their life. Because for me, I'm starting to see that as the totality, you are taking yourself to all these different areas. Exactly. Good. Good. That's what I hoped you would see that and so my only caution would be because some folks like to think about like where could we go um unless the client really asks you specifically for an intervention of that magnitude i think it would be inappropriate to and you could discuss it with the client as to where you might go, but I think it would be inappropriate without telling the client to take them beyond the contexts or much farther than the context which you began with. Yeah. But you could just see, for me, my lights are just going off in my head about all the connections from now and maybe six months, a year, two years later that's just going to be like, it's just a Christmas tree that keeps lighting up. Yes, yes. And that is what we talk about when we talk about generative change. That's the difference between what you just saw as the difference between remedial change, where a client comes in, they're broken, then they get fixed, to generative change where there are things where the client's growth opens up and where they continue to grow. So the client doesn't just come in for a problem that's solved. The client comes in and some changes occur in that process which continue to generalize and continue to make a lot of difference in the client's life. Yeah, we're actually, I'm going to be talking about this in just a few tapes, but we're going to get there, because we're almost to a point where we're going to talk
[1466.46 - 1468.22]  this afternoon about NLP and healing
[1468.22 - 1470.54]  as we sort of complete our Mastery of Practitioner training.
[1470.54 - 1473.74]  But with reference to the process of Hakala,
[1474.62 - 1475.96]  Sun saying, that's who I am,
[1476.48 - 1480.02]  is actually typical of the response
[1480.02 - 1484.12]  of someone who's picked up a higher level of truth
[1484.12 - 1489.18]  by going into the state of expanded awareness
[1489.18 - 1489.96]  or peripheral vision.
[1490.58 - 1492.12]  That's a reasonably common response.
[1493.22 - 1498.34]  And what it is is that she's actually gone to the level of...
[1498.34 - 1499.86]  Remember the bottom of the bubble diagram,
[1500.02 - 1502.06]  which is slide number 107?
[1504.06 - 1549.42]  What she's actually done is gone to that area that knows only truth, slide number 107, which is at the bottom left. So what's happened is we've used her neurological drivers, or we've used her getting in contact with the whole of her neurology, or awareness or dropping into the void, which then got her to the area which knows only truth, so she picked up some truths and then really got that that's who she was or is, so it's not an issue, thus having changed the context. Yep? Okay. So that's a demonstration of handling away from. So that's a demonstration of handling away from so that's a demonstration of
[1549.42 - 1552.84]  of noticing what happens when we work with some away from
[1552.84 - 1559.52]  this is the end of tape 26 side b
