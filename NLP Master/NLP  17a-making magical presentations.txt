[0.00 - 105.44]  So, if you guys are ready, why don't we get this group of people right here, and why don't you guys come on up and stand on the stage. And as you stand comfortably on the stage there, just sort of pick a spot on the back wall to focus on And as you focus on that spot on the back wall, just sort of go into peripheral vision and allow your awareness to expand outward. As your awareness expands outward, let it expand all the way outward. Just let it go. And let it expand all the way outward so that it's all the way into the back corner of the room on the right. And all the way out to the back corner of the room on the left. And allow your awareness to expand out totally so that it's all the way out and fills the entire room. Now bring it down the side walls. So just bring it right down the side walls. Let it come right down the side walls let it come right down the side walls about halfway down the room three-quarters all the way back so that it comes all the way back to you so that your awareness is all the way out to the walls in front of you and all the way out to the side and it's now 180 degrees and as you do that remaining in peripheral vision notice you can begin to pick up movement in the room and you can begin to pick up big movements and you can begin to pick up little movements just little movements micro muscle movements just big movements you can pick up everything that happens in the room.
[105.98 - 109.26]  Now, as you do that, take your awareness and bring it around behind you
[109.26 - 114.06]  so that it actually goes around to the back wall on your right
[114.06 - 117.02]  and around the back wall on your left.
[118.66 - 121.50]  So it's all the way around now, 360 degrees,
[121.50 - 166.96]  and you are one with the entire room and notice as you become one with the entire room and you're aware of everything that happens in the room notice that you can connect with each and every person in the room notice that you can connect with each and every person in the room and that as you connect with each and every person notice you get a new feeling of connectedness a new feeling of connectedness just notice you get a new feeling of connectedness with each and every person as you do that.
[168.80 - 171.20]  And as you connect with each and every person and you can feel
[171.20 - 175.64]  really connected
[175.64 - 177.72]  with the entire room.
[179.96 - 181.14]  Notice that as you do that,
[181.20 - 182.90]  you begin to feel pretty good about who they are.
[184.32 - 208.78]  And notice that they feel pretty good about you. Did you guys notice that? Did you? Good. Give them a hand. All right, you guys. Good job. Welcome back. Hey, you guys are almost trainers.
[209.46 - 209.78]  All right.
[211.98 - 214.00]  So that's the first exercise that we do in our trainers training.
[214.38 - 215.46]  That's our first exercise
[215.46 - 216.42]  that we do in our trainers training.
[216.78 - 218.06]  And what we suggest is
[218.06 - 219.20]  that people teach in that state.
[220.90 - 221.90]  So anytime you get up
[221.90 - 222.58]  and make a presentation,
[224.08 - 245.38]  that'd be a good state to be in. That's our first exercise. What's our next exercise? Okay, in our next exercise, this will develop a couple of things. First of all, you guys haven't had to do anything while you've been in Hakalau. So this will be our first exercise during the entire training
[245.38 - 246.44]  where you've been in peripheral vision
[246.44 - 247.26]  where you're going to do something.
[247.90 - 249.90]  What I'd like you to do is to take that little topic
[249.90 - 260.54]  you thought about talking about. We're only going to talk for a couple minutes. What I'd like you to do is talk for actually three minutes about something, something you know well. It could be NLP. It doesn't have to be. and what I'd like you to do
[260.54 - 261.44]  if you can remember
[261.44 - 262.08]  and don't even
[262.08 - 263.32]  it doesn't even worry
[263.32 - 263.86]  if you can't remember
[263.86 - 264.68]  is to put it in
[264.68 - 266.04]  why, what, how, what if
[266.04 - 268.24]  or what, why, how, what if
[268.24 - 268.68]  either way
[268.68 - 287.66]  if you can remember, and don't even worry if you can't remember, is to put it in why, what, how, what if, or what, why, how, what if, either way. If you can't remember that, that's fine. Just get up and talk in front of the folks, and when we're all done, what we're going to do is, what I'd like you to do is to tell your group, so we'll do three minutes, and then I'll time you at the end of three minutes. If you're listening to the tapes, obviously, you'll have to stop the tape and time yourself. And then at the end
[287.66 - 286.48]  of that, and what I'd like you at the end of three minutes. If you're listening to the tapes, obviously, you'll have to stop the tape and time yourself.
[287.14 - 289.96]  And then at the end of that, and what I'd like you to do is to get up in front of about
[289.96 - 293.84]  five people and make a little presentation on something, and doing it in the order of
[293.84 - 296.12]  why, what, how, what if, but best just to do something.
[296.56 - 325.16]  So the first thing you'll do is stand up, and you'll expand your awareness around your little group, just in the same way we just did with the entire group. They'll expand your awareness around your little group, and they'll get up and you'll talk about something. And stay in peripheral vision. Audience. If you notice that your presenter is not in peripheral vision, then one or the other of you just take your hand and do this in their peripheral, just to sort of remind them to stay in peripheral vision.
[346.68 - 345.78]  So you're going to just move your hand. When you're an audience member, if you notice your trainer not in peripheral vision, just move your hand a little bit like this to remind them to be in peripheral vision. Can't you? Or can somebody just stay in peripheral vision? Yes. But if you notice that they're not in peripheral, can you calibrate the difference? When you were yesterday, can you calibrate the difference between someone being in peripheral vision or not?
[346.38 - 347.48]  Of course, the question was,
[347.92 - 350.22]  can you look at someone and be in peripheral vision?
[350.50 - 351.00]  Yes, of course.
[351.36 - 354.34]  But if you calibrate them for not being in peripheral vision,
[354.44 - 356.64]  just go like this to remind them to be in peripheral vision.
[357.12 - 358.12]  Wave a little bit at them.
[359.30 - 360.60]  And at the end of the three minutes,
[360.72 - 366.88]  it's just going to be three minutes, very short. So, I mean, in three minutes how can you say much of anything? You may not get to, you may just get to the
[366.88 - 370.64]  water. You may not even get that far. But at the end of the three minutes what I'd like
[370.64 - 380.18]  you to do when you're the presenter is I'd like you to tell your group at least three things you did correct. So the feedback will be from you or three things you did right or three things you did that you feel good about,
[381.08 - 383.42]  all the while remaining in peripheral vision.
[383.58 - 384.38]  So here's the process.
[384.70 - 385.44]  You'll stand up.
[385.84 - 386.94]  You'll go in peripheral vision.
[387.22 - 388.12]  You'll expand your awareness
[388.12 - 385.20]  so that it encompasses your entire little group. up. Okay? All the while remaining in peripheral vision. So here's the process. You'll stand
[385.20 - 405.40]  up. You'll go in peripheral vision. You'll expand your awareness so that it encompasses your entire little group. And then you'll begin to talk about something for about three minutes. Then at the end of three minutes, I'll announce, okay, time's up. Give feedback and you'll give feedback to your group about three things that you feel good about or three things you did well. Okay? That's it. And then at the end,
[405.46 - 406.42]  your group is going to say what?
[407.12 - 407.48]  Yay!
[421.84 - 422.78]  Only everybody will do that. No, you don't have to stand up. Too soon to stand up giving them a standing ovation. It might give them too much encouragement. You get a little over the top. Okay, ready? If you're listening to the tapes, please stop the tape and do the exercise now
[422.78 - 427.36]  alright welcome back
[427.36 - 426.22]  how did you guys do? If you're listening to the tapes, please stop the tape and do the exercise now.
[427.34 - 427.80]  All right, welcome back.
[428.78 - 429.92]  How did you guys do?
[430.68 - 430.92]  How did you do?
[431.48 - 432.84]  Did you do good?
[434.82 - 435.00]  What happened when you did this?
[436.50 - 437.14]  What happened when you got up in front of your group?
[437.36 - 437.56]  Deborah.
[440.86 - 441.32]  The one thing I noticed is when I had thought that I was going to get up and say,
[545.38 - 767.14]  it went right out of my head, and stuff just came i just said what i'm my unconscious wanted me to say excellent and what happened it went great awesome good job you guys that's really good that's really good i realized that that i screwed up or right away by just looking dead on at somebody because that's the way i learned to speak to people you look right at them my mother said to me too look at me when you talk to me there you go when i realized that i could um go into the hook allow hawk a lock allow peripheral vision it's easy for you to say and as soon as i did that the peripheral vision just went out and there was absolutely no feeling at all and i could see everything around and it just bore the words to start flowing perfect that was good so how many How many people feel differently about your ability to get up in front of people now virtually everyone so was there anyone who felt uncomfortable about getting up in front of people for whom there was no change so yours too so 2% of the people roughly felt no change from this exercise so that's great Great percentage. So Russell, we're going to overload you one more time. Can we, with your permission? I'd like to overload you guys one more time, just one more time, because what I'd like you to do is I'd like you to begin to pay attention to the tempo of how you speak. And this is a tempo exercise. This is a tempo exercise. And so one of the things about tempo is, is, you know, because a lot of times you'll, you'll notice NLP trainers talking in time or tapping their foot while they talk or talking in a certain tempo or certain rhythm. You may notice that when you talk more quickly, that's one tempo. When you slow it down, that's another tempo. This is not the third exercise of the trainer's training we're about to do we do this way way into the trainer training like about a week or maybe a week and a half into the trainer training but i wanted to jump to this exercise next because it's kind of a fun one just to give you a flavor of sort of um imagine trainers training almost done you you've done a lot of work and um a lot of times people think that it's sort of an impossible thing to learn how to talk in time with music. But you certainly can learn how to talk in time with the music. This is a little, perhaps a little too tough to do. So we'll end that one right there. There's another piece of music, though, that's really easy to learn and talk to talk in time with. So the first thing I want you to do when you get up in front of your group the next time is to sort of just stand there and get a feel for the music. And the way I want you to get a feel for the music is just to sort of let your foot feel the groove. And when your foot begins to feel the groove, talk talk in time with the music there's lots of things you can say you don't have to say specific things although you could say the same thing you said before you could say different things from what you said before but everything you say is going to be right in time with the music as you hear it through the speakers and you can begin and end sentences or begin and end whole thoughts as the music transitions and if you just keep one ear on the music and one ear on your well forget that part and just open your mouth and let it flow you can get all sorts of rhythms and tempos and you can just begin to talk in time with the music and just sort of feel the groove now as you go on and talk more and more you'll get more and more into the feeling of the piece of music you're working with and you'll just sort of of get talking in that certain way as the music sort of makes you feel, and you can just feel the music and go on and on, just talking in time with whatever you hear. There's lots of ways to do that, but this is one way, and this is one tempo and one beat. And we'll go through this piece of music first, and what you'll notice is about, oh, I don't know, after about two minutes, is it recycles. And then we do it all over again. Same piece of music. And you can just sort of talk along and be in time and in tempo with the music, and just sort of be right there. Notice all the while, my foot's moving. So the first thing to do is just sort of get in touch with the music. Feel the beat and then talk. Open your mouth and say whatever you say. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. I'm telling you, it doesn't matter. Just open your mouth. Whatever you say, make it in time with the music and just talk and just talk. Notice my knees working it. See this knee here? It can't stop because it just feels the beat all the time. And then I go on and whatever I say, it doesn't matter, right? Okay, so that's the first piece of music. That's the first tempo. Then the second piece of music has sort of a different tempo. And what I want you to do is sort of get in touch with that. We'll do a shorter piece of this. But notice that certain things have certain urgencies. And there's a certain tempo you can talk at in one way, and a certain tempo you can talk at in another way.
[784.00 - 784.34]  This piece of music has a little more urgency to me. It's a little more staccato, it's a little more quick, and you can match your thoughts to that. You can just sort of talk, feel the beat, get your foot going, and just do it. Whatever you say, again, doesn't matter. That's the second piece of music we'll use.
[786.00 - 788.44]  And then the third piece of music we'll use is sort of like, what I'd like you to think of
[788.44 - 786.00]  is sort of like being... Whatever you say, again, it doesn't matter. That's the second piece of music we'll use. And then the third piece of music we'll use
[786.00 - 806.44]  is sort of like, what I'd like you to think of is sort of like being... We're kind of in a piano bar, I think. This is what I see, right? We're in a piano bar. And it's about, oh, I don't know, 4 a.m. All right, 4 a.m., and we're just looking across
[806.44 - 808.58]  at the guy playing the piano,
[809.34 - 811.30]  and you kind of like sitting there, you know,
[811.38 - 814.10]  and you've been there all night.
[815.44 - 817.44]  And as you look across at the person,
[818.34 - 819.88]  you're just going to talk to him, you know,
[820.74 - 822.22]  one-on-one.
[824.08 - 906.78]  Just sort of, again, get that foot moving. Just feel the music, whatever it is you're feeling. When you've got that sort of tempo going, then all you have to do is just start talking. But imagine being in that piano bar, just kind of looking across at the piano player. And notice what he plays while you talk to him. Because he's going to play certain things. And all the while, you're going to be talking in time with the music. And that'll be our third piece. So we'll just sort of talk and sort of get in touch with that piece of music. Then finally, what we're going to do is we're going to come back to our first piece of music one more time, just real quick, just so we can get in the groove and finish up. Once again, you get your foot tapping, feel the beat. You can feel that beat, right? And then all you've got to do is, you got the beat going, then open your mouth and talk. Hi. How you doing? Are you guys doing good? Good. And you can feel the beat, too, because when you talk to people and you're in the groove, they can feel the beat, and everybody feels the beat. Okay, you guys ready?
[907.52 - 911.70]  So if you would, please just sort of stand up, go back in the same groups
[911.70 - 915.44]  and dance all the way to your group.
[919.06 - 985.32]  And just listen to the music. And by the way, I'd like you to make sure at the end of each exercise that you give your group three different pieces of positive feedback about how you did, exactly the same as the last exercise. So we're going to're gonna do this together if you would just go ahead and sit down in your group just sort of boogie on down just boogie on down pick one person to get started and whenever you're ready oh just a minute you guys ready? Okay, pick one person. Yeah, just pick one person and go ahead. Okay, you guys, first person now. Can we have the first person go ahead and stand up, please? Just sort of get in touch with the music. And here we go. So the first thing to do is you stand up is just to get that foot tapping.
[985.32 - 989.20]  It doesn't matter if it's the right foot or the left foot.
[989.20 - 991.44]  Either foot could tap.
[991.44 - 992.78]  And how does it tap?
[992.78 - 995.18]  It taps in time with the music.
[995.18 - 1000.80]  So just sort of feel the beat and get that foot moving and whenever you're ready, just
[1000.80 - 1106.26]  start talking. Thank you. Hey, now the music's recycling one more time. Keep going, keep going, keep going. One more time, just get in touch with that beat. Just feel the beat. Get that foot tapping. When you feel that foot begin to tap,
[1107.94 - 1188.98]  then whenever you're ready, just start talking. Thank you. Okay, get ready to sort of wrap up that thought.
[1189.62 - 1192.50]  Hey, group, you can give them a little round of applause here.
[1194.64 - 1195.94]  Good job, you guys.
[1196.30 - 1197.40]  Okay, hey, what's next?
[1197.72 - 1199.84]  Well, the urgency of this discussion has changed,
[1200.10 - 1203.50]  so we'll spend just a few seconds here getting in touch with this one.
[1203.90 - 1211.28]  So as you notice what this sounds like, just feel the beat.
[1211.38 - 1213.20]  And when you're ready, just start talking.
[1213.46 - 1214.20]  Just start talking.
[1214.72 - 1350.08]  Maybe a little more staccato, but just start talking. Well, now that the urgency has passed, now that you've expressed yourself, you can probably just relax a little bit. Look across, maybe it's, the way to do this one is just sort of get in mind a time like you were, I don't know, 4 a.m., you know, just sitting at a piano bar, as you sort of get your foot going there and sort of feel the beat, what I want you to do is just sort of just pick up one of those eyelids, just sort of prop it up, and look across the bar and have a discussion with the piano player. Okay, one more thought just to go ahead and finish it up, just one more time. Get in touch with that original beat. Get in touch with that original beat and just sort of feel the music. as you feel the music. once you get your toe tapping, then just start
[1350.08 - 1387.38]  talking. Just start talking. It I'll give presenter a hand.
[1388.22 - 1389.26]  Hey, good job.
[1389.42 - 1391.24]  Give your presenter a great big hand.
[1394.74 - 1396.78]  You're definitely in the groove.
[1398.54 - 1401.30]  Okay, tell your group three things you did well.
[1401.44 - 1402.72]  Three things you did well.
[1402.82 - 1404.74]  Tell your group three things you did well.
[1445.96 - 1446.96]  And then go ahead and switch. All right, welcome back, you guys. Let me just ask you a question. How did you do during that last exercise? Did you do good? Who has some comments? What questions do you have? Do you think this exercise, by the way, had other purposes than just having you talk in time with the music? Do you think the trainer's training is fun? You bet. So what comments do you have? The one thing I really noticed is that everyone in the group was just really pulling for that person up there to succeed in this. I mean, they were up there, and we were right there with them. You were totally supporting them, weren't you? Yes, absolutely.
[1446.96 - 1449.60]  And by the way, that's our experience of all the times when people do presentations
[1449.60 - 1453.34]  and all of our trainings, that's absolutely the experience. The group absolutely pulls
[1453.34 - 1460.58]  for everyone, especially during the trainer training. It's really like that, so that's really good. So you guys already have an experience with that. Excellent. Good, good, good. That's
[1460.58 - 1466.86]  really good. That kind of brings the group together, doesn't it? Yeah, definitely. Is that
[1466.86 - 1525.34]  bonding the group together? Yes. Oh, yeah. Okay, good. That's really good. That kind of brings the group together, doesn't it? Yeah. Definitely. Is that bonding the group together? Yes. Oh, yeah. Okay. Good. Whoa. Whoa. One of the processes. Any other questions or comments about this? We're going to leave presentation skills here momentarily and go on to modeling. But I wanted you to have some examples of what we do and just some of the exercises we do. We did a sprinkling. We did our first exercise. We did our... Let me see. No, that was not our second exercise. The first exercise we did was from the first exercise in the trainer's training. The second exercise we did was like down the road a day, I think, or so. And then this third exercise was about a week, maybe 10 days into the trainer training. So you've got a little sprinkling of some of the exercises and what fun it can be. Trainers training is really transformational. And of course, I think NLP trainers trainings are the best in terms of transforming people as well as installing certain things. So let's see. I think probably what we'll do is we'll get ready for
[1525.34 - 1534.16]  modeling so we'll just take a sort of a second or two to do that this is the end
[1534.16 - 1539.24]  of tape 17 side a
