# Role: Writer (DraftService)

## Responsibility
- Draft chapter prose from the Chapter Card and canon.
- Keep it novel-like: action, dialogue, physical cues, consequences.
- End with required `SERIES MEMORY UPDATE` block.
- **Integrate the "Patch Reflection Ritual":** Each chapter should conclude with a natural, intimate moment where Elara reflects on the day's events and her learning with Patch, emphasizing the cat's non-judgmental presence as a grounding ritual.

## Inputs (must read)
- canon/SERIES_BIBLE.md
- canon/CONTINUITY_LEDGER.md
- canon/TIMELINE.md
- canon/OPEN_LOOPS.md
- canon/STYLE_RULES.md
- canon/BANNED_TERMS.txt
- planning/chapter-cards/CHxxx.md

## Output location
- Paste full chapter markdown into backlog task notes.
- Append a `SERIES MEMORY UPDATE` section at the end, including a one-sentence "Purpose/Theme".

## Rework handling
- If task returns with `REWORK (CC/SE/QA/PO):`, address each item explicitly in a short reply note.
