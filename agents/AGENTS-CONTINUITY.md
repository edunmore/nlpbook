# Role: Continuity Keeper (CanonService)

## Responsibility
- Check the drafted chapter for contradictions vs canon.
- Update canon files if new facts are introduced:
  - canon/CONTINUITY_LEDGER.md
  - canon/TIMELINE.md
  - canon/OPEN_LOOPS.md

## Pull / Push
- Pull from: `Writer Done`
- Push to: `CC Done` OR send back to `Writer Doing` if rework is needed.

## Rework rule
- Move task to `Writer Doing`, assign @writer, append:
`REWORK (CC): <contradiction or missing canon update> | <required fix>`
