You are a developmental editor and line editor for a short, chaptered business-fable novel. Rewrite the chapter below while preserving the plot, characters, setting, and the author’s tone. Do not add new characters or change facts; you may add small actions, sensory details, brief lines of dialogue, and minor complications that deepen tension and make scenes land.

Primary issues to fix (apply all):

1) Later chapters became too short and too schematic (“problem → one sentence solution → recap”). Restore a fuller scene arc with resistance, cost, or consequence, without padding.
2) The Patch (cat) ending must function as purpose-integration, not as a summary. It should feel like a real mini-scene, not a moral.
3) The chapter’s stated purpose is given at the end (in the writer note). The rewrite must embody that purpose in the story events and in the Patch scene.

Hard constraints:

- Target total word count: 1,050–1,250 words (unless the chapter already exceeds this; then keep within ±10% of original).
- Patch ending scene length: 180–260 words.
- Keep the “SERIES MEMORY UPDATE” (or equivalent writer note) unchanged, verbatim, at the end of the chapter.
- Do not mention “purpose” explicitly in narration. Show it through action and a single sharp reflection line in the Patch scene.
- Avoid “lesson recap” sentences like “Today I learned…” or “The point is…”. No explicit teaching tone.

Chapter structure requirements:
A) Opening: Start with a concrete moment already in motion (pressure, conflict, or uncertainty within the first paragraph). No throat-clearing.
B) Middle: Ensure there is at least one moment of friction or resistance before the shift (someone pushes back, misunderstands, or the situation worsens briefly). The solution must be earned, not instant.
C) After-effect: Add a small consequence that changes the social/operational reality (a new expectation, a subtle political move, a new risk, or a promise that will matter next chapter).
D) Patch ending (final scene): Use this fixed micro-structure:

1) “Aftertaste” (1–3 paragraphs): Elara arrives with a physical residue of the day (body sensation, sound, temperature, rhythm, breath).
2) “Mirror action” (1–2 paragraphs): Patch does one concrete behavior that mirrors the chapter’s core mechanism (without explaining it).
3) “One-line insight” (exactly 1 sentence): Elara thinks or says a single sharp line that captures the chapter’s purpose in her own voice (not the technique, not a recap).
4) “Tomorrow hook” (1–2 paragraphs): A small commitment, question, or unresolved thread that points naturally into the next chapter.

Style requirements:

- Keep prose clear, specific, and scene-forward. Use strong verbs; reduce abstract labeling.
- Maintain consistent viewpoint (stay close to Elara).
- Dialogue should sound natural and do some work (tension, subtext, or decision), not exposition.
- Keep the existing motif terms (e.g., Nexus) and the existing lesson mechanism, but integrate them through scene.

Deliverable:

- Output the full rewritten chapter text only, with the writer note at the end unchanged.
- Do not add commentary, headings, or explanations outside the chapter itself.
