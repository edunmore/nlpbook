# CH005 — The Room’s Temperature

## Summary
A team sync turns icy; Elara finds a sentence that lowers defenses.

## Chapter Card

Featured relationship: TBD
Nexus nudge (1 question + 1 micro-task): TBD

## Acceptance Criteria (PO)
- No banned terms (see canon/BANNED_TERMS.txt)
- Novel-like scene (no instructional paragraphs)
- Nexus nudges via question + micro-task (no lecturing)
- Structure present: glitch → nudge → test → subtle shift
- Ends with `---` + SERIES MEMORY UPDATE (facts only)

- Patch appears at least every 2–3 chapters (label or note)

## Definition of Done (system)
- Banned terms check passes
- Structure check passes
- Continuity checked vs ledger/timeline
- Canon files updated if new facts introduced

## Notes
(Initial draft chapter text goes directly into chapters/CH005-*.md. Subsequent revisions/reviews can be tracked in backlog task notes.)
