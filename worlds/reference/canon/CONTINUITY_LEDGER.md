# Continuity Ledger (Canon)

## Setting
- Modern city; glass-and-steel office; winter to early spring pacing (adjust as needed).
- Recurring locations: Elara’s apartment; office floors; one quiet third place (e.g., park/tea kiosk or a late-night diner).

## Project
- Critical infrastructure upgrade with public visibility.
- Current phase (start): kickoff / planning moving into rehearsal.

## Characters: facts that must remain consistent
- Elara leads architecture and coordination.
- Ben leads implementation details; stability-first.
- Nexus is available through a company system; cryptic and restrained.
- Patch is Elara’s cat (rescue) with warm-electronics habit.

## Who knows what (start)
- Elara: aware of project risk; not aware of her own tightening loop.
- Ben: feels scrutinized; not yet openly discussing fears.
- Mara: aware of external pressure; not fully disclosed to team.
- Sana: sees risk early; not yet in Elara’s inner circle.
