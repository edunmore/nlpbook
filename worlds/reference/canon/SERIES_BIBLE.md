# Series Bible — The Coder and the Compass (Canon)

## Premise
A critical infrastructure upgrade begins to fail for human reasons. Elara is brilliant and ambitious, but stuck in a tightening loop of control. Ben is capable, but mismatched in rhythm and interpretation. Nexus, an experimental AI, becomes a cryptic compass: never lecturing, always nudging via small tasks and questions.

## Main cast
### Elara Voss
- Role: Systems architect leading a high-visibility upgrade.
- Signature: precision, speed, composure; under stress her jaw tightens, shoulders rise, and her attention narrows.
- Private rule (early): “If I don’t control it, it will fail.”
- Growth direction: from tightening → making space; from fixing people → collaborating with them.

### Ben Calder
- Role: Lead engineer on the upgrade.
- Signature: careful, stability-first, sensitive to implied critique; can become defensive when rushed.
- Growth direction: from guarded → candid; from lone correctness → shared clarity.

### Nexus
- Role: Experimental AI used via terminal/chat.
- Signature: calm, slightly cryptic, occasionally funny. Uses short questions, metaphors, and micro-tasks.
- Hard rule: never explains; never lectures; never cites external authorities.
- Function in story: turns Elara’s assumptions into experiments.

## Supporting cast (starter set)
### Mara Voss (CTO)
- Pressure vector: external deadline, reputation, risk tolerance.
- Signature: short sentences; decisive; sees politics as weather.

### Jonah Reed (Product Lead)
- Pressure vector: vague “feel” requirements and late changes.
- Signature: charismatic, fast-talking, optimistic; unintentionally destabilizes.

### Sana Iqbal (Reliability/SRE)
- Pressure vector: reality checks, incident readiness.
- Signature: dry humor; sees patterns early; becomes an ally.

### Pia Novak (Design/Research)
- Pressure vector: human nuance, tone, and clarity.
- Signature: perceptive, grounded; helps Elara practice subtle communication without “performing.”

## Patch (the cat)
- A rescue cat adopted by Elara (or living with her). Name: Patch.
- Quirks: sits on warm electronics; appears during quiet moments; vanishes when the apartment is tense.
- Story function: nonverbal barometer + intimacy + comic relief.

## Recurring motifs (use lightly)
- Cursor blinking; unsent message; coffee going cold; glass walls; elevator silence.
- Patch interfering at inconvenient moments.
- Micro-pauses before replies.
- Attention widening from “one thing” to “whole room.”
