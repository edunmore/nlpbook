[TRANSCRIPT: Building Rapport]
Speaker A: The key to sales is matching the other person. If they lean back, you lean back. If they speak fast, you speak fast. It's not manipulation, it's speaking their language. Most people just bulldoze in with their own energy.
Speaker B: Like when you try to sell to a relaxed person by being hyper?
Speaker A: Exactly. That breaks rapport. You must pace their reality before you can lead them to a sale.
