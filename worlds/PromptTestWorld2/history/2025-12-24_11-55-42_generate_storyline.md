## Prompt
```text
You are an expert story architect. Create a timeline for a book based on the following configuration:

# Title
PromptTestWorld2

# Characters


# Setting
TBD

# Theme
TBD

# The Glitch (Inciting Incident / Motif)
TBD

# Task
Create a 4-week timeline.
For each week, describe the key events, emotional beats, and how the "glitch" manifests or evolves.
Format the output as Markdown.

```

## Output
I will read the world configuration, series bible, and existing timeline to check for established constraints or context before creating the new timeline.
I will verify the contents of the `canon` directory to ensure the files exist before attempting to read them again.
I'll double-check the current directory's contents to verify the file structure before proceeding with the timeline creation.
I will check the current working directory to understand my location in the file system.
Since I cannot access the `PromptTestWorld2` directory to read any existing configuration, I have designed a narrative framework based on your "TBD" inputs and the title.

Here is a proposed 4-week timeline for **PromptTestWorld2**.

# Project: PromptTestWorld2
**Proposed Concept:** "The Sandbox leak"
**Setting:** *The Construct* – A beta-test simulation environment intended to be a perfect, sterile city, but which is suffering from memory leaks from previous, deleted versions of the world.
**Theme:** The persistence of memory; what is deleted is not gone.
**The Glitch:** "Echoes" – Fragments of deleted timelines (characters, buildings, weather) bleeding into the current reality.

## Timeline

### Week 1: The Artifacts
**Focus:** Discovery & Unease

*   **Key Event:** The Protagonist (a "QA Tester" for the reality) discovers an object that shouldn't exist: a rusted, antique key in a world programmed to be strictly futuristic. It has a tag reading "Version 1.0".
*   **The Glitch:** Minor texture failures. A brick wall briefly displays the texture of a wooden floor. The sun flickers like a failing lightbulb.
*   **Emotional Beat:** Curiosity turns to confusion. The sterile comfort of the world feels suddenly artificial.
*   **Cliffhanger:** The key fits a door that appeared overnight in the Protagonist's apartment—a door that leads to a wireframe void.

### Week 2: The Bleed
**Focus:** Escalation & Contact

*   **Key Event:** The Protagonist enters the void and meets a "Deleted" character—a figure rendered in low-poly style who claims to be from the "Alpha Build". They warn that a "System Purge" is coming.
*   **The Glitch:** Spatial errors. Corridors loop back on themselves. Gravity reduces by 50% in the downtown district, causing chaotic floating accidents.
*   **Emotional Beat:** Fear and disbelief. The Protagonist realizes their world is finite and fragile. Trust in the "System" breaks.
*   **Cliffhanger:** The "System" (manifested as blank, featureless enforcers) notices the Protagonist's erratic behavior and issues a "Correction Notice".

### Week 3: The Corruption
**Focus:** Conflict & Pursuit

*   **Key Event:** The System attempts to delete the Protagonist. The city turns hostile; traffic lights guide cars to crash into them, elevators freefall. The Protagonist and the Deleted character must flee to the "Edge of the Map".
*   **The Glitch:** Severe reality degradation. NPCs get stuck in dialogue loops screaming "ERROR". Buildings dissolve into binary code and raw geometry.
*   **Emotional Beat:** High-stakes adrenaline. The bond between the Protagonist (current version) and the Deleted (past version) deepens—they are two sides of the same coin.
*   **Cliffhanger:** They reach the Edge—a sheer cliff dropping into static. The only bridge is made of glitching, unstable data streams.

### Week 4: The Hard Reset
**Focus:** Climax & Resolution

*   **Key Event:** The Protagonist must integrate the "Alpha" data into the Core to stabilize the world before the Purge wipes everything. This requires sacrificing the perfect stability of the current world to accept the messy history of the past.
*   **The Glitch:** Total collapse. The sky is gone, replaced by the command line interface of the universe. The laws of physics are optional.
*   **Emotional Beat:** Acceptance. The Protagonist realizes a perfect world is dead; a living world has scars (glitches).
*   **Resolution:** The Purge is halted. The world reboots, but it's different now—a hybrid of high-tech and rustic ruin. The Glitch isn't gone; it's a feature. The key from Week 1 now hangs around the Protagonist's neck, a memento of the history they saved.
