## Prompt
```text
You are an expert World Builder and Editor.

# Goal
Refine and expand the world configuration based on the current state and any user instructions.

# Current World State
Title: BrowserTestWorld

## Setting
Veridia Bay, a hyper-connected near-future metropolis where an ubiquitous Augmented Reality overlay known as ' The Mesh' beautifies every aspect of urban life.

## Theme
The shattering of convenient illusions and the cost of truth in a curated reality.

## The Glitch (Inciting Incident)
The Desync: During a routine firmware update for the city's optical implants, the protagonist witnesses the 'Mesh' flicker and fail for exactly three seconds, revealing a gray, decaying city and subliminal commands hidden in advertisements, which no one else seems to remember.

## Characters
- Alex Chen (Protagonist): A junior systems architect for the city's municipal data center who feels suffocated by the perfection of The Mesh. They are the only one who recorded the Desync data before it was wiped.
  Tags: Observant, Tech-savvy, Restless
- Dr. Elara Vance (Mentor): One of the original architects of The Mesh who vanished from public life a decade ago. She communicates via analog radio frequencies, guiding Alex on how to see without the overlay.
  Tags: Reclusive, Brilliant, Paranoid
- Director Kaelen Voss (Antagonist): The head of 'Synapse', the corporation maintaining The Mesh. He believes the illusion is necessary for social stability and views any breach of the system as a threat to human survival.
  Tags: Charismatic, Ruthless, Order-obsessed
- Jules 'Glitch' Kovic (Ally / Wildcard): A street artist who hacks local AR nodes to display graffiti that the system tries to delete. They want to tear The Mesh down completely, regardless of the chaos it would cause.
  Tags: Anarchist, Hacker, Unpredictable
- Marcus Reed (Skeptic): Alex's childhood friend and a high-ranking officer in the city's digital security force. He represents the comfort of the status quo and is torn between his duty to Synapse and his friendship with Alex.
  Tags: Loyal, Grounded, Fearful


# Instructions
1. **Analyze** the current state above. Look for any text starting with "AI:" or "Instruction:" - these are direct commands from the user to change something (e.g., "AI: make the tone darker").
2. **Refine** the content.
   - If an "AI:" instruction exists, apply it and **remove** the instruction text.
   - If fields are empty, generate high-quality, creative content fitting the title/genre.
   - Ensure consistency between Setting, Theme, Glitch, and Characters.
3. **Expand** characters.
   - You can modify existing characters if instructed.
   - You can add new characters if the world feels empty (aim for ~5 key characters total).
   - Ensure characters have conflicting goals and clear roles.
