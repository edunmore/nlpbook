## Prompt
```text
You are a story architect.
Create a chapter map (outline) for a book based on the approved brainstorm concepts.

# Story Context
**Title**: The Invisible Thread
**Theme**: A person learns to see what was always there
**Setting**: A small consulting firm in a modern city
**Characters**:
- Maya Chen (Protagonist): A brilliant but rigid project manager who believes everything can be solved with logic and spreadsheets.
- The Mentor (Guide): A quiet, observant senior consultant who notices patterns others miss.


# Approved Concepts (from brainstorming)
1. **The hidden agenda of transformation**
   - A mentor figure reveals that their goal isn't to transfer knowledge or skills, but to fundamentally alter the personality or worldview of the listener, creating a tension between education and manipulation.
   - Scene idea: During a seemingly standard performance review, a senior partner leans in and whispers to a junior associate, 'I'm not interested in teaching you the job. I'm going to change who you are,' leaving the associate unsettled yet intrigued.

2. **The expert's language barrier**
   - A character possesses a sophisticated, abstract skill set that sounds meaningless or suspicious when described to outsiders, creating a wall of isolation between their professional identity and their personal relationships.
   - Scene idea: At a loud family dinner, the protagonist tries to explain their specific role at the consulting firm to an elderly relative. When they use accurate terms, the relative looks blank; when they simplify it, they sound like a fraud. The protagonist gives up, feeling invisible despite their success.

3. **The warning label on influence**
   - A character explicitly warns others that they are using persuasive tactics on them right now, but the warning is delivered so charmingly that the listeners ignore it, falling into the trap anyway.
   - Scene idea: In a boardroom, a consultant starts a presentation by saying, 'Everything I'm about to say is designed to bypass your logic and make you trust me.' The board members chuckle, thinking it's a joke, while the consultant proceeds to do exactly that.

4. **The Tunnel Vision Trap**
   - When a character focuses so intently on a specific detail (like a statistic or a single line of text) that they literally lose the ability to perceive the emotional atmosphere of the room. By 'unfocusing' on the data, they suddenly notice the crucial non-verbal reality surrounding them.
   - Scene idea: The protagonist is aggressively proving a point using a spreadsheet, staring only at the numbers. They fail to notice the client has physically leaned back and crossed their arms, signaling withdrawal. A mentor whispers to 'look at the walls, not the screen,' prompting the realization.

5. **The Dictionary of One**
   - The realization that a common word has a radically different definition depending on the specific environment or history of the listener. Conflict arises not from what is said, but from the invisible 'dictionary' the listener is using to decode it.
   - Scene idea: A consultant asks a legacy team to 'streamline' a process. To the consultant, this means 'make faster.' To the team, based on past trauma, 'streamline' means 'layoffs.' The room erupts in panic over a seemingly positive suggestion.

6. **Watching the Dance, Ignoring the Music**
   - A shift in perception where a character stops listening to the *topic* of an argument (the content) and starts watching the *pattern* of the interaction (the process/structure). They realize the fight about coffee is the exact same 'dance' as the fight about budgets.
   - Scene idea: Two department heads are screaming about office seating charts. The protagonist tunes out the words and notices the rhythm: one attacks, the other deflates, then explodes. By disrupting the rhythm rather than solving the seating chart, the conflict vanishes.

7. **The Self-Fulfilling Expectation**
   - Just as an observer changes the behavior of light by how they measure it, a character shapes the outcome of a meeting simply by the attitude they walk in with. Their belief about a 'hostile' client forces the client to become hostile.
   - Scene idea: The protagonist prepares for a negotiation with a reputation for being 'impossible.' By entering the room with defensive body language and guarded speech, they accidentally trigger the exact aggression they feared, turning a neutral situation into a conflict.

8. **The Fractal Flaw**
   - Based on the idea that the smallest piece contains the memory of the whole, a character realizes that a tiny, seemingly insignificant habit of a team leader perfectly mirrors a massive structural failure in the company.
   - Scene idea: During a due diligence audit, the protagonist realizes that the way the CEO organizes their personal desk drawer—hiding clutter underneath a polished surface—is the exact same method used to hide millions in debt in the company ledgers.

9. **The Body's Veto**
   - The intellect agrees to a plan, but the body (every cell) holds a different 'memory' or truth. A character says 'yes' to a request, but their physical reaction screams 'no,' creating a visible dissonance that others ignore.
   - Scene idea: A team verbally commits to an ambitious new project deadline with smiles, but the protagonist notices everyone in the room has simultaneously stopped breathing deeply or started unconsciously protecting their vital organs (crossing arms, hunching), revealing they know the project is doomed.



# Task
Create a chapter map with 9 chapters.
Each chapter should:
1. Feature ONE primary concept from the approved list
2. Advance the character arc
3. Build on previous chapters
4. End with a hook or subtle shift

# Format
Return a markdown list like this:
```markdown
# Chapter Map

- CH001: **[Title]** — [One-sentence summary of what happens and which concept it explores]
- CH002: **[Title]** — [Summary]
...
```

IMPORTANT: Do NOT use any banned terminology. Focus on what characters DO, not what techniques they use.

```

## Output
Here is the chapter map for **The Invisible Thread**, structured to guide the protagonist Maya Chen from rigid logic to perceptive intuition.

# Chapter Map

- CH001: **The Blind Spot** — Maya presents a perfect data-driven strategy but fails to notice the client’s physical withdrawal until a mentor points out she was looking at the screen, not the room (**The Tunnel Vision Trap**).
- CH002: **The Terms of Engagement** — When Maya asks for better negotiation techniques, the Mentor refuses to teach her "skills" and instead unsettles her by stating his true goal is to alter her fundamental personality (**The Hidden Agenda of Transformation**).
- CH003: **Untranslatable** — Maya attempts to explain her new, abstract insights to her family at dinner but finds herself isolated by the specialized nature of her experience, unable to bridge the gap between her professional and personal worlds (**The Expert's Language Barrier**).
- CH004: **Defining the Danger** — Faced with a team ready to revolt over a reorganization plan, Maya diffuses the situation by realizing they aren't reacting to her actual proposal, but to their own traumatic definition of the word "streamline" (**The Dictionary of One**).
- CH005: **The Transparent Trap** — Maya watches in disbelief as the Mentor wins over a hostile board by explicitly warning them that he is about to bypass their logic to gain their trust, a warning they charmngly ignore (**The Warning Label on Influence**).
- CH006: **Ignoring the Lyrics** — During a heated executive dispute about office space, Maya tunes out the arguments to observe the repetitive interaction pattern, realizing the "dance" of attack and retreat is the real problem, not the seating chart (**Watching the Dance, Ignoring the Music**).
- CH007: **The Drawer and the Ledger** — While auditing a potential partner, Maya discovers a massive financial cover-up solely by observing how the CEO hides clutter in his personal desk drawer, recognizing the part mirrors the whole (**The Fractal Flaw**).
- CH008: **The Enemy in the Room** — Maya almost tanks a crucial meeting by expecting hostility, but catches herself and consciously shifts her internal stance, watching the "aggressive" client immediately soften in response to her own change (**The Self-Fulfilling Expectation**).
- CH009: **The Unanimous No** — In the final boardroom scene, the team verbally agrees to a merger, but Maya spots the collective flinch in their bodies and risks her career to call out the unspoken "veto" everyone is feeling (**The Body's Veto**).
