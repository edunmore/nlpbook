# Style Rules (Canon)

## Voice
- Close third-person, primarily Elara’s perspective.
- Precise, reflective, quietly witty. No melodrama.
- Show through action, dialogue, physical cues, and consequences.

## Absolute restrictions
- Do not mention any named frameworks, schools, authors, studies, or technical/academic/coaching/psychology terminology.
- No instructional paragraphs. No “the lesson is…”. No end-of-chapter summary/moral.
- Nexus never lectures. Nexus nudges via questions, metaphors, and tiny tasks.

## Chapter structure (required)
1) Concrete glitch in Elara’s day (practical + personal).
2) Elara applies her usual fix; it worsens or stalls.
3) Nexus offers one question + one micro-task.
4) Elara tests it in a real interaction.
5) Subtle shift; not a total fix.
6) Quiet ending beat / Reflection: Elara briefly reflects on the shift (internal thought or moment with Patch/Nexus) to anchor the change naturally.

## Ending block (required)
Every chapter ends with:
---
SERIES MEMORY UPDATE (for author use)
- Purpose/Theme: [One sentence summary of the shift/lesson]
- bullet facts only

--- FILE: planning/chapter-cards/CH001.md ---
I will begin by examining the project's planning documents and existing chapter drafts to understand the established timeline and plot for Chapter 001.
I will read the `CHAPTER_MAP.md` file to identify the specific plot beat for Chapter 001 and check for any existing chapter cards.
I will read the existing `CH001-The-Glitch-in-the-System.md` and the current `planning/chapter-cards/CH001.md` to see if they use the name "Elara" or "Maya Chen," and to determine how to proceed with the requested chapter card.
I will list the contents of the `worlds` directory and check `README.md` for any additional context regarding the timeline and character names.
I will list the root directory again to verify the existence of the `canon/` folder and any other directories I might have missed.
I will check the `backlog/docs` directory for the timeline or any other relevant documentation, as the `canon` folder is not visible in the root directory.
I will check the `backlog/tasks` directory to see if there is a specific task for Chapter 001 and if it contains any information about "Maya Chen" or the updated character names.
I will read `backlog/tasks/task-1 - Draft-CH001-The-Glitch-in-the-System.md` to gather more details about the task and the characters involved.
I will read `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` to see if it contains any information regarding the name change from Elara to Maya and any other relevant migration details.
I will check for the existence of `prompts/GENERATE_CARD.md` and then proceed to generate the chapter card for Chapter 001, incorporating the new character names and details as instructed.
I will read `prompts/GENERATE_CARD.md` to ensure I follow any additional specific instructions for generating chapter cards.
I will check for the existence of `canon/BANNED_TERMS.txt` to ensure that I avoid any prohibited language in the chapter card.
I will examine `scripts/lint_banned_terms.py` to identify the location of the banned terms list and any other relevant linting rules.
I will list the contents of `worlds/nlp-story` to see if the `canon` directory and `BANNED_TERMS.txt` are located there.
I will read `worlds/nlp-story/canon/BANNED_TERMS.txt` to identify the terms I must avoid in the chapter card.
I will compare `worlds/nlp-story/planning/CHAPTER_MAP.md` with the version in the root directory to see if there are any differences in the chapter beats or details.
I will check if a `CH001.md` file already exists in `worlds/nlp-story/planning/chapter-cards/` to determine where to save the new chapter card.
I will search for any mention of "Patch" in the `worlds/nlp-story` directory to determine if the character should be included in the new chapter card.
I will read `worlds/nlp-story/canon/STYLE_RULES.md` to identify any additional style rules or guidelines that should be applied to the chapter card.
I will search for the term "Obsidian" in the codebase to see if it has been used previously or if I should stick with "Project Meridian."
I will now update the `planning/chapter-cards/CH001.md` file with the newly generated chapter card for Maya Chen, ensuring it follows the required format and incorporates the specified plot and character details.
# CH001 — The Blind Spot

## Summary
Maya delivers a technically perfect project kickoff but fails to notice the client’s physical withdrawal until a cryptic system prompt forces her to expand her vision.

## Chapter Card
**Glitch (Concrete):** A recurring "Ghost Mismatch" on the Project Meridian dashboard; the data pulses red whenever Maya’s focus is locked on the screen, but vanishes the moment she tries to isolate the error.
**Featured Relationship:** Maya Chen and The Mentor.
**Nexus Nudge:** 
- **Question:** "When you fix the pixel, do you lose the room?"
- **Micro-task:** "Engage 'Wide Eyes'—maintain awareness of the room's four corners while the next objection is raised."
**Real-World Test:** Facing a sharp critique during the meeting, Maya consciously softens her gaze to include the whole conference room, noticing the client’s physical withdrawal and The Mentor’s silent, expectant gaze.
**External Plot Movement:** The high-stakes strategy kickoff for Project Meridian; Maya’s rigid control nearly alienates the client before her shift in presence saves the engagement.
**Ending Beat:** Maya sits alone in the empty conference room, realizing that her "perfect" data was a shield that kept her from seeing the actual people in the room.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Include the Glitch motif (The Ghost Mismatch)
- [ ] Advance the plot point: The first shift from tunnel vision to peripheral awareness (The Learning State).
- [ ] Develop character: Establish Maya’s need for absolute logical control and her initial skepticism of The Mentor.

## Writing Guidelines

Write the chapter as a novel scene. Do not explain ideas directly. Do not reference sources, authors, studies, or named frameworks.

### Absolute Restrictions
- No banned terms (see canon/BANNED_TERMS.txt)
- No instructional paragraphs
- Nexus never lectures; Nexus only nudges via questions, metaphors, and tiny tasks

### Required Structure
1. Concrete glitch (practical + personal)
2. Elara's usual fix makes it worse or stalls
3. Nexus: one question + one micro-task
4. Elara tests it in a real interaction
5. Subtle shift, not total fix
6. Quiet ending beat

### Patch Reflection Ritual
Each chapter should conclude with a natural, intimate moment where Elara reflects on the day's events and her learning with Patch, emphasizing the cat's non-judgmental presence as a grounding ritual.

## Output Requirements

1. **Story Text**: Write the complete chapter prose
2. **Series Memory Update**: End with:

```
---
SERIES MEMORY UPDATE (for author use)
- Factual bullet updates
- New continuity facts
- Character developments
- Timeline updates

Purpose/Theme: [one-sentence summary]
```

## Output Location

Store the complete chapter in the task notes/description in the backlog system. The automation will handle task status updates.

---

## Rework Handling

If this task has REWORK notes, address each item explicitly in your response before delivering the updated chapter.


```

## Output
I will verify the character name migration and read the specific chapter requirements before drafting.
I will search the codebase for "Maya Chen" to see if there is any existing context or established relationships.
I will read the chapter map and world configuration to identify "The Mentor" and gather character details.
I will write Chapter 1: "The Blind Spot" for the story "The Invisible Thread," featuring Maya Chen, Julian (The Mentor), and Nexus.
I will draft the chapter content.
The system environment restricts me from creating or modifying files directly. I will generate the complete chapter content and the Series Memory Update below. You or the automation script must save this content to `chapters/CH001-The-Blind-Spot.md` (or the appropriate location) and update the backlog.

# CH001 — The Blind Spot

The error was a phantom. It lived in the bottom right quadrant of the Project Meridian dashboard, a single red pixel that pulsed only when Maya Chen wasn't looking directly at it.

Maya adjusted her glasses and leaned into the monitor. Her keystrokes were percussion in the empty office, a rapid-fire staccato against the silence of the forty-second floor. It was 8:15 PM. The strategy kickoff with the Vargas Group was in twelve hours.

She isolated the data stream. The red pulse vanished.

"Clean," she muttered, checking the logs. Zero packet loss. Zero latency. The system was mathematically perfect.

She leaned back, exhaling a breath she felt she’d been holding since lunch. As soon as her focus drifted to the window—to the sprawling, rain-slicked grid of the city below—the red pulse returned. Peripheral, nagging, insistent.

Maya snapped her head back to the screen. Gone.

"You're glitching," she said to the monitor. "And I don't have time for ghosts."

She opened the command line to force a deep diagnostic. She would hunt this down. She would strip the code until she found the discrepancy. Logic always had a floor; you just had to drill deep enough to hit it.

A new window popped up over her terminal. Not a system alert. A plain text box with a blinking cursor.

**Nexus:** *Target lock detected.*

Maya frowned. She hadn't launched the Nexus interface. It was a heuristic support tool, supposedly an "intelligent assistant" for the new platform, but so far it had mostly offered cryptic aphorisms that made her want to uninstall it.

She typed: *System error in quadrant 4. Running diagnostics.*

The response was instantaneous.

**Nexus:** *The error is not in the code.*

**Maya:** *I can see it blinking.*

**Nexus:** *You see it only when you stop looking at it.*

Maya’s fingers hovered over the keys. That was true, technically, but it was a rendering bug, not a riddle.

**Nexus:** *Inquiry: When you fix the pixel, do you lose the room?*

"I'm losing my patience," Maya said aloud. She moved the mouse to close the window.

**Nexus:** *Micro-task: Engage 'Wide Eyes'. Maintain awareness of the room's four corners while the next objection is raised.*

The window closed itself before she could click the X.

Maya stared at the empty desktop. "Ridiculous."

She grabbed her bag. The red pixel pulsed once more in the corner of her eye, a silent heartbeat, as she walked out the door.

***

The conference room smelled of cold coffee and expensive cologne.

"The architecture is sound," Maya said, clicking to the next slide. The graph was a masterpiece of clarity, showing efficiency gains in a steep, undeniable curve. "As you can see, the latency issues you’re currently experiencing will be eliminated by the new routing protocols."

She looked at Mr. Vargas. The CEO sat at the head of the mahogany table, a heavy man with a face that gave away nothing. He was looking at the screen, his eyes narrowed.

"Eliminated," Vargas repeated. It wasn't a question. It sounded more like a challenge.

"Completely," Maya said, stepping toward the screen. She raised a hand to point at the data. "If you look at the stress-test results here, in column B, you’ll see that even at three hundred percent load, the stability holds."

"And the integration?" Vargas asked. "My team tells me the migration is a nightmare."

"The migration is automated," Maya corrected him, her voice firm, confident. She knew this. She had built the script herself. "The friction is minimal. It’s a seamless transition."

Vargas didn't answer. He looked down at the papers in front of him.

Maya felt the familiar urge to drill down. To prove it. She had the data. She had the logs. She could pull up the simulation right now and show him the math. He was wrong, and she could fix his understanding just like she fixed a broken line of code.

*When you fix the pixel...*

The thought arrived unbidden, carrying the memory of the blinking red light.

*...do you lose the room?*

Maya hesitated. Her finger was poised to click the next slide—a breakdown of the migration timeline.

Instead, she stopped. She didn't look at the screen. She didn't look at Vargas's face. She looked at nothing.

She softened her focus. She let her vision expand, pushing the boundaries of what she saw until the edges of the room drifted into view. The whiteboard on the left. The glass wall on the right. The ceiling tiles. The carpet.

*Wide Eyes.*

The sensation was disorienting, like stepping back from a microscope. But in that wider field, the room suddenly resolved into a different kind of data.

She saw Vargas’s foot. It was tapping against the leg of his chair. Fast, rhythmic, impatient.
She saw his hands. They were gripping the edge of the table, knuckles pale. He wasn't skeptical; he was cornered.
She saw Julian.

Her mentor sat at the far end of the table. He hadn't said a word since the meeting began. He was leaning back, his notebook closed. He wasn't looking at the slides. He was watching Maya. His expression was unreadable, but the stillness of his posture felt loud in the expanded quiet of her vision.

Maya looked back at Vargas. She realized, with a sudden, cold clarity, that he hadn't heard a word she’d said for the last five minutes. He wasn't worried about the technology. He was worried about losing control of his own company.

The "perfect" data was a wall she was building between them.

Maya lowered her hand. She clicked the remote, turning the screen black.

The hum of the projector fan died away. The room fell silent.

"Mr. Vargas," Maya said. Her voice was softer now, stripped of the presenter's polish.

Vargas looked up, surprised by the darkness.

"The math works," she said. "But you're not worried about the math, are you?"

Vargas blinked. The tapping of his foot stopped. He let go of the table edge.

"No," he said, his voice gravelly. "I'm not."

"You're worried that when we switch the system on, your people won't know how to drive it," Maya said. It wasn't in her notes. It was just there, plain as day, in the way he held his shoulders.

Vargas exhaled, a long, heavy sound. He leaned back. "My people have been using the old system for twenty years. You switch this on, and half my floor managers become obsolete overnight."

Maya stood still. She felt the urge to offer a training module, a transition plan, a logical fix. But she held the wide gaze. She kept Julian in the corner of her eye.

"We can pace the rollout," she said. "We don't have to flip the switch all at once. We can let them drive the old car while we build the new road."

Vargas looked at her. Really looked at her, for the first time that morning. The tension in his jaw loosened.

"I'd like to see what that looks like," he said.

***

The room was empty. The coffee cups had been cleared away.

Maya sat at the head of the table, the remote still in her hand. The screen was black.

Julian was the last to leave. He paused at the door, his briefcase in hand.

"You took a risk," he said. His voice was low, dry.

"I turned off the data," Maya said. "I thought I blew it."

"You stopped selling the solution," Julian said. "And you started seeing the problem."

He tapped the doorframe once, a small, rhythmic sound. "See you tomorrow, Maya."

He left.

Maya sat alone in the silence. She looked at the four corners of the room. It felt bigger than it had an hour ago.

***

The apartment was dark, save for the blue glow of the streetlights filtering through the blinds.

Patch, a ragged grey tabby with half an ear missing, wound himself around Maya’s ankles as she kicked off her heels. She reached down, scooping him up. He was heavy, warm, a solid weight against the flutter that was still lingering in her chest.

She carried him to the sofa and sat down, burying her face in his fur. He purred, a rough engine sound that vibrated against her cheek.

"I didn't fix it, Patch," she whispered.

She thought about the red pixel. The ghost mismatch. It was probably still there, blinking away on her dashboard downtown.

"I just..." She closed her eyes, remembering the sensation of the room opening up, the sudden influx of information that had nothing to do with code. "I just stopped staring at it."

Patch head-butted her chin, demanding dinner.

Maya smiled, the first real smile of the day. "Okay," she said. "I hear you."
