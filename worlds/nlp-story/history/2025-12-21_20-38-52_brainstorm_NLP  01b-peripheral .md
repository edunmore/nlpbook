So just for a second, what I'd like you to do is noticing when you're in that state, what happens to your focus? What happens to your focus? When you go into that state, when you go into that state, what happens to your focus? Murray? It's blurred in a sense, and yet I'm aware of much more at the same time, even though centrally I'm not really seeing so clearly as normal, and yet I'm taking in everything in the room.

It's easy. Yeah, yeah. Now, before you were focused on what, and what are you focused on when you go into this state? In other words, still looking ahead, but everything around sort of comes in. Yeah, everything around, and what is everything around?

Well, movement all around, in other words. Right, you're getting there. Who has an idea about what you're focusing on when you're actually in this state? In terms of, I don't know if you've thought of this before, but when you're focusing on the central part of your vision, are you focusing on content? And when you're focusing on the peripheral part of your vision, are you focusing on...

Process. Context. Context. You are, aren't you? Because when you say, Murray, when you say, when you look at that, you're focusing on, you know, you kind of focus in, then you're focusing on everything around.

Right. Is that right? Yeah. So are you focused on context then? I mean, neurologically?

Yeah, I guess I would be, huh? Yeah. Think about that for just a moment. Think about that for just a moment, because I do want to talk about context and content. I want to talk about context and content, and I think that, I think I want to talk about it in this way.

Let's look at slide number 11. Alfred Korzybski in the book Science and Sanity in 1933 said the map is not the territory. Actually, he talked about, and I don't know if you know, if you've ever considered what that means in terms of the presuppositions of NLP. Of course, we've had lots of discussions. The map is not the territory.

People go, yeah, yeah, okay, the map's not the territory. Sure, sure. I don't know if you know what that means, but what it is, and Krasivsky actually in his book said, someday in the future, this was in 1933, someone will come up with a purely processed description of the human being, which of course we think NLP is a purely processed description of the human being. What do we focus on when we focus on structure, process, or context is we focus on the pattern that exists. So although we may have lots of content, what we're looking for as we look at our NLP patterns is we're focusing on structure, process, or context.

In fact, what does the map is not the territory mean? What Korzybski said was, he said the words we use are dependent upon the context in which they appear for their meaning. All of the, did you ever, I don't know if you know how they make a dictionary, but if you were going to make a brand new dictionary and you didn't want to borrow Funk and Wagnalls or Random House or whatever dictionary you've got, you know how you'd make a dictionary? You'd actually buy up all the books in print. This is how you do it.

And you'd make a three-by-five card for every word that you found in each of the books that was unique, and you'd determine the meaning of the word from the context in which it appeared. That's pretty much how they make a dictionary. Then they go out and talk to people and find out if there are any words they don't have. And they usually find quite a few. And then they determine the meaning of those words from the context in which they appear.

What Krasivsky said in Science Insanity was that all words are dependent upon the context in which they appear for their meaning. Which, if that's the case, if that's the case, if all meaning is dependent upon the context in which it appears, if all meaning is dependent upon the context in which it appears, then the only meaning is context, process, or structure.

# Story Context
**Title**: The Invisible Thread
**Theme**: A person learns to see what was always there
**Setting**: A small consulting firm in a modern city

# Important Constraints
- Do NOT use any technical/academic terminology from the source (e.g., no "NLP", "meta-model", "rapport", "reframe", "presupposition", etc.)
- Transform technical concepts into **observable human behaviors** and **relatable situations**
- Focus on what the concept LOOKS LIKE in real life, not what it's CALLED

# Task
Extract 3-5 story concepts. Each concept should be:
1. A human behavior or situation (not a technique name)
2. Something that could create drama or tension
3. Specific enough to inspire a scene

# Format
Return a JSON list:
[
  {
    "concept": "The moment someone realizes their words landed differently than intended",
    "description": "A character sends a message they think is helpful, but the recipient reads it as criticism. The gap between intention and reception creates conflict.",
    "scene_idea": "Email exchange where 'let me know if you need help' reads as 'you're not capable'"
  }
]

```

## Output
```json
[
  {
    "concept": "The Tunnel Vision Trap",
    "description": "When a character focuses so intently on a specific detail (like a statistic or a single line of text) that they literally lose the ability to perceive the emotional atmosphere of the room. By 'unfocusing' on the data, they suddenly notice the crucial non-verbal reality surrounding them.",
    "scene_idea": "The protagonist is aggressively proving a point using a spreadsheet, staring only at the numbers. They fail to notice the client has physically leaned back and crossed their arms, signaling withdrawal. A mentor whispers to 'look at the walls, not the screen,' prompting the realization."
  },
  {
    "concept": "The Dictionary of One",
    "description": "The realization that a common word has a radically different definition depending on the specific environment or history of the listener. Conflict arises not from what is said, but from the invisible 'dictionary' the listener is using to decode it.",
    "scene_idea": "A consultant asks a legacy team to 'streamline' a process. To the consultant, this means 'make faster.' To the team, based on past trauma, 'streamline' means 'layoffs.' The room erupts in panic over a seemingly positive suggestion."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Watching the Dance, Ignoring the Music",
    "description": "A shift in perception where a character stops listening to the *topic* of an argument (the content) and starts watching the *pattern* of the interaction (the process/structure). They realize the fight about coffee is the exact same 'dance' as the fight about budgets.",
    "scene_idea": "Two department heads are screaming about office seating charts. The protagonist tunes out the words and notices the rhythm: one attacks, the other deflates, then explodes. By disrupting the rhythm rather than solving the seating chart, the conflict vanishes."
  }
