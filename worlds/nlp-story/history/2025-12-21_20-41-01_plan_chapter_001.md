```

## Output
I will begin by examining the project's planning documents and existing chapter drafts to understand the established timeline and plot for Chapter 001.
I will read the `CHAPTER_MAP.md` file to identify the specific plot beat for Chapter 001 and check for any existing chapter cards.
I will read the existing `CH001-The-Glitch-in-the-System.md` and the current `planning/chapter-cards/CH001.md` to see if they use the name "Elara" or "Maya Chen," and to determine how to proceed with the requested chapter card.
I will list the contents of the `worlds` directory and check `README.md` for any additional context regarding the timeline and character names.
I will list the root directory again to verify the existence of the `canon/` folder and any other directories I might have missed.
I will check the `backlog/docs` directory for the timeline or any other relevant documentation, as the `canon` folder is not visible in the root directory.
I will check the `backlog/tasks` directory to see if there is a specific task for Chapter 001 and if it contains any information about "Maya Chen" or the updated character names.
I will read `backlog/tasks/task-1 - Draft-CH001-The-Glitch-in-the-System.md` to gather more details about the task and the characters involved.
I will read `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` to see if it contains any information regarding the name change from Elara to Maya and any other relevant migration details.
I will check for the existence of `prompts/GENERATE_CARD.md` and then proceed to generate the chapter card for Chapter 001, incorporating the new character names and details as instructed.
I will read `prompts/GENERATE_CARD.md` to ensure I follow any additional specific instructions for generating chapter cards.
I will check for the existence of `canon/BANNED_TERMS.txt` to ensure that I avoid any prohibited language in the chapter card.
I will examine `scripts/lint_banned_terms.py` to identify the location of the banned terms list and any other relevant linting rules.
I will list the contents of `worlds/nlp-story` to see if the `canon` directory and `BANNED_TERMS.txt` are located there.
I will read `worlds/nlp-story/canon/BANNED_TERMS.txt` to identify the terms I must avoid in the chapter card.
I will compare `worlds/nlp-story/planning/CHAPTER_MAP.md` with the version in the root directory to see if there are any differences in the chapter beats or details.
I will check if a `CH001.md` file already exists in `worlds/nlp-story/planning/chapter-cards/` to determine where to save the new chapter card.
I will search for any mention of "Patch" in the `worlds/nlp-story` directory to determine if the character should be included in the new chapter card.
I will read `worlds/nlp-story/canon/STYLE_RULES.md` to identify any additional style rules or guidelines that should be applied to the chapter card.
I will search for the term "Obsidian" in the codebase to see if it has been used previously or if I should stick with "Project Meridian."
I will now update the `planning/chapter-cards/CH001.md` file with the newly generated chapter card for Maya Chen, ensuring it follows the required format and incorporates the specified plot and character details.
# CH001 — The Blind Spot

## Summary
Maya delivers a technically perfect project kickoff but fails to notice the client’s physical withdrawal until a cryptic system prompt forces her to expand her vision.

## Chapter Card
**Glitch (Concrete):** A recurring "Ghost Mismatch" on the Project Meridian dashboard; the data pulses red whenever Maya’s focus is locked on the screen, but vanishes the moment she tries to isolate the error.
**Featured Relationship:** Maya Chen and The Mentor.
**Nexus Nudge:** 
- **Question:** "When you fix the pixel, do you lose the room?"
- **Micro-task:** "Engage 'Wide Eyes'—maintain awareness of the room's four corners while the next objection is raised."
**Real-World Test:** Facing a sharp critique during the meeting, Maya consciously softens her gaze to include the whole conference room, noticing the client’s physical withdrawal and The Mentor’s silent, expectant gaze.
**External Plot Movement:** The high-stakes strategy kickoff for Project Meridian; Maya’s rigid control nearly alienates the client before her shift in presence saves the engagement.
**Ending Beat:** Maya sits alone in the empty conference room, realizing that her "perfect" data was a shield that kept her from seeing the actual people in the room.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Include the Glitch motif (The Ghost Mismatch)
- [ ] Advance the plot point: The first shift from tunnel vision to peripheral awareness (The Learning State).
- [ ] Develop character: Establish Maya’s need for absolute logical control and her initial skepticism of The Mentor.
