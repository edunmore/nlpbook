Here is the chapter map for **The Invisible Thread**, structured to guide the protagonist Maya Chen from rigid logic to perceptive intuition.

# Chapter Map

- CH001: **The Blind Spot** — Maya presents a perfect data-driven strategy but fails to notice the client’s physical withdrawal until a mentor points out she was looking at the screen, not the room (**The Tunnel Vision Trap**).
- CH002: **The Terms of Engagement** — When Maya asks for better negotiation techniques, the Mentor refuses to teach her "skills" and instead unsettles her by stating his true goal is to alter her fundamental personality (**The Hidden Agenda of Transformation**).
- CH003: **Untranslatable** — Maya attempts to explain her new, abstract insights to her family at dinner but finds herself isolated by the specialized nature of her experience, unable to bridge the gap between her professional and personal worlds (**The Expert's Language Barrier**).
- CH004: **Defining the Danger** — Faced with a team ready to revolt over a reorganization plan, Maya diffuses the situation by realizing they aren't reacting to her actual proposal, but to their own traumatic definition of the word "streamline" (**The Dictionary of One**).
- CH005: **The Transparent Trap** — Maya watches in disbelief as the Mentor wins over a hostile board by explicitly warning them that he is about to bypass their logic to gain their trust, a warning they charmngly ignore (**The Warning Label on Influence**).
- CH006: **Ignoring the Lyrics** — During a heated executive dispute about office space, Maya tunes out the arguments to observe the repetitive interaction pattern, realizing the "dance" of attack and retreat is the real problem, not the seating chart (**Watching the Dance, Ignoring the Music**).
- CH007: **The Drawer and the Ledger** — While auditing a potential partner, Maya discovers a massive financial cover-up solely by observing how the CEO hides clutter in his personal desk drawer, recognizing the part mirrors the whole (**The Fractal Flaw**).
- CH008: **The Enemy in the Room** — Maya almost tanks a crucial meeting by expecting hostility, but catches herself and consciously shifts her internal stance, watching the "aggressive" client immediately soften in response to her own change (**The Self-Fulfilling Expectation**).
- CH009: **The Unanimous No** — In the final boardroom scene, the team verbally agrees to a merger, but Maya spots the collective flinch in their bodies and risks her career to call out the unspoken "veto" everyone is feeling (**The Body's Veto**).
