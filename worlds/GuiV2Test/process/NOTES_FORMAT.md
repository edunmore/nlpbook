# Notes Format Convention (Backlog Task Notes - for Chapter Revisions and Reviews)

This convention applies to notes and feedback captured within backlog tasks for chapters that have already been initially drafted into the `chapters/` directory. Initial chapter drafts are now created directly in `chapters/CHxxx-*.md`.

Use versioned blocks so iterations are traceable:

DRAFT v1:
```md
...full chapter markdown...
```

CC REVIEW:
- ...

REWORK v2 NOTES:
- ...

DRAFT v2:
```md
...full chapter markdown...
```

SE EDIT:
- ...

QA CHECK:
- PASS/FAIL + notes

PO REVIEW:
- Accept / Rework + notes
