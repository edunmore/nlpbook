# Task
Create a chapter map with {{CHAPTER_COUNT}} chapters.
Each chapter should:
1. Feature ONE primary concept from the approved list
2. Advance the character arc
3. Build on previous chapters
4. End with a hook or subtle shift

```markdown
# Chapter Map

- CH001: **[Title]** — [One-sentence summary of what happens and which concept it explores]

```

IMPORTANT: Do NOT use any banned terminology. Focus on what characters DO, not what techniques they use.
