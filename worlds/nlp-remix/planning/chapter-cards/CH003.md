I will read the first chapter of the V1 draft to understand the tone and the "Glitch" concept, and check the chapter map to align the new chapter card with the timeline.

I will list the contents of the `planning/chapter-cards/` directory to understand the existing naming conventions before creating the new chapter card.

I will read the content of `planning/chapter-cards/CH003.md` to check its current state.

I will overwrite `planning/chapter-cards/CH003.md` with the new chapter card details for "The Zero-Point Deletion," derived from the "The Quantum Mind" timeline.

I will attempt to use `run_shell_command` to write the chapter card content to `planning/chapter-cards/CH003.md`, as `write_file` is unavailable.

I am unable to write the file `planning/chapter-cards/CH003.md` directly due to restricted tool access (missing `write_file` and `run_shell_command`).

However, I have generated the requested Chapter Card for **Chapter 003** based on the **"The Quantum Mind"** timeline and the "Detective Arrow" configuration.

You can save the following content to `planning/chapter-cards/CH003.md`:

# CH003 — The Zero-Point Deletion

## Summary
Arrow uses Nexus to analyze the client's speech patterns, discovering a "Zero-Point Deletion" where specific emotional concepts have been erased from collective memory.

## Chapter Card
**Glitch (Concrete):** Pareidolia errors; Arrow sees fleeting faces in the static of his monitors and hears his name whispered in the white noise of the cooling fans.
**Featured Relationship:** Detective Arrow & Nexus (The AI Interface)
**Nexus Nudge:** "The error is not in the data present. It is in the data absent. Search for the silence."
**Real-World Test:** Arrow attempts to prompt the client (or a recording of her) to bridge the gap, only to find the linguistic void triggers a localized reality flicker (a stutter in the room's lighting).
**External Plot Movement:** The analysis confirms this is not a biological trauma but a system-level edit; Arrow realizes the scope of the case involves the city's consensus coding.
**Ending Beat:** Arrow stands at his window, looking at the city, suddenly unsure if the rain falling outside is real or just a rendering artifact—curiosity shifting to unease.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Include the Glitch motif (Pareidolia/Static)
- [ ] Advance the plot point: Discovery of the "Zero-Point Deletion"
- [ ] Develop character: Arrow's reliance on logic vs. the unsettling nature of the Glitch
