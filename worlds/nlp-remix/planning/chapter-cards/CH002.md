I will read the `GEMINI.md` file to understand the specific task instructions and `V1/CH001-The-Glitch-in-the-System.md` to establish the narrative context.
I will read `V1/CH002-Wide-Eyes.md` to verify the content of the existing second chapter and determine if it aligns with the "Detective Arrow" timeline or the previous "Elara Voss" narrative.
Here is the Chapter Card for **Chapter 002** of the **Detective Arrow** storyline, based on the provided timeline.

```markdown
# CH002 — The Terminal

## Summary
Detective Arrow investigates "The Terminal," a consensus-reality sector, to trace the origins of his client's missing emotions, only to discover that the data hasn't been stolen—it has been erased from existence.

## Chapter Card
**Glitch (Concrete):** Pareidolia errors; Arrow sees faces forming in the static of a flickering neon sign and hears his own name whispered in the white noise of the city grid.
**Featured Relationship:** Detective Arrow & Nexus (His AI Linguistic Analyzer).
**Nexus Nudge:** *Inquiry:* "Search for the negative space. What remains when the signal is removed?" *Task:* Scan for the "Zero-Point Deletion."
**Real-World Test:** Arrow visits the sector where the client was last seen ("The Terminal") and attempts to engage with the locals who speak in "consensus coding" (vague language that shifts reality). He uses the Nexus filter to strip away the consensus overlay.
**External Plot Movement:** Arrow physically travels to the high-tech, unstable "Terminal" district; street signs flicker and change text based on the semantic density of the crowd.
**Ending Beat:** Arrow confirms the "Zero-Point Deletion" finding; the realization that the client's emotions weren't just suppressed, but *edited out* of the collective memory, leaving him with a deep sense of unease about the stability of his own map.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Establish the setting of "The Terminal" where reality fluctuates based on language/consensus.
- [ ] Introduce Nexus as a tool for "Deep Structure" analysis, not just data retrieval.
- [ ] Show the first concrete Glitch (Pareidolia) affecting Arrow's own senses.
- [ ] End with the specific diagnosis of the "Zero-Point Deletion."
