I will read the existing draft of Chapter 1 to match the tone and style before generating the Chapter Card.
# CH001 — The Surface Structure

## Summary
Detective Arrow accepts a case from a woman whose speech is perfectly logical yet devoid of all emotional content, a phenomenon that triggers a series of sensory glitches in his own perception of the city.

## Chapter Card
**Glitch (Concrete):** Pareidolia — Arrow sees a screaming face form in the rain streaking his office window, but when he focuses, it’s just water.
**Featured Relationship:** Detective Arrow & The Hollow Client (Elara Voss variant or new character "Client X").
**Nexus Nudge:** *Inquiry:* "You are listening to the notes, but missing the melody. Scan for Zero-Point Deletions."
**Real-World Test:** Arrow attempts to calibrate the client's baseline by asking a highly emotional question ("Tell me about the day you lost it"), expecting a physiological shift, but gets zero micro-expressions.
**External Plot Movement:** The client provides the "hook"—a missing memory file or a "hollow" period of time that she cannot access, hiring Arrow to find her lost Deep Structure.
**Ending Beat:** Arrow stands alone in his office; he tries to dismiss the face in the rain as fatigue, but his hand trembles slightly as he lights a cigarette (or pours a drink), realizing his own "map" might be compromised.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Introduce Detective Arrow and his unique methodology (Linguistic Analysis).
- [ ] Establish the setting: The Agency / The Terminal (Atmospheric, Noir-Futurism).
- [ ] Introduce the "Hollow Client" and the concept of "Surface Structure" (words without feeling).
- [ ] Manifest the Glitch as a sensory error (Pareidolia) to challenge Arrow's acuity.
- [ ] Establish Nexus as a tool for "Deep Structure" analysis.
