Here is the 4-week timeline for your book project "Coaching".

# Book Timeline: Coaching

**Logline:** A corporate marketing veteran pivots to life coaching, only to find her "beta" coaching app knows more about her—and her clients—than is technically possible, forcing her to confront the one metric she can't optimize: herself.

**The Glitch (Defined):** The app, intended to be a simple CRM/scheduler, suffers from a "bug" where it sends cryptic, unsolicited notifications or alters data in ways that serve as profound, intuitive advice, often challenging the protagonist's corporate armor.

---

## Week 1: The Beta Test (Initialization)

**Focus:** establishing the status quo and disrupting it.

*   **Key Events:**
    *   **Day 1:** The Coaching Lady (Protagonist) sets up her pristine, Instagram-worthy home office. She downloads "The Guide" (The App) to manage her practice.
    *   **Day 3:** She conducts practice sessions with friends, using stiff, corporate jargon. She feels hollow.
    *   **The Glitch Manifests:** During a mock session, the App freezes. The screen flickers and displays a notification: *"Error 404: Empathy Not Found."* She assumes it's a software bug and tries to report it.
    *   **Day 7:** She gets her first inquiry from a real potential client. She spends 12 hours preparing a slide deck.

*   **Emotional Beats:**
    *   High manic energy (New beginnings!) masking deep insecurity (Am I a fraud?).
    *   Annoyance at the "buggy" technology.

## Week 2: The False Positive (Disruption)

**Focus:** The Glitch forces a change in behavior.

*   **Key Events:**
    *   **Day 1:** Minutes before her first big client call, the App "crashes" and seemingly deletes her carefully prepared slide deck. The screen goes blank, leaving only a single pulsating prompt: *"Just Listen."*
    *   **Day 2:** Forced to improvise without her props, she actually listens to the client. The session is raw and surprisingly successful. She lands the client.
    *   **The Glitch Evolves:** She checks the App logs later. The slide deck was never deleted; it was just hidden. The App sends a push notification: *"Optimization Complete."*
    *   **Day 5:** She tries to trick the App, inputting fake client data to see if it "knows." The App responds with a calendar invite for *"Time to be honest with yourself"* set for right now.

*   **Emotional Beats:**
    *   Sheer Panic $\rightarrow$ Forced Vulnerability $\rightarrow$ Exhilaration.
    *   She begins to suspect the App is not just broken, but *watching*. A mix of creeped-out and intrigued.

## Week 3: System Overload (Dependency)

**Focus:** Reliance on the external aid becomes a crutch.

*   **Key Events:**
    *   **Day 1:** Business is picking up. She stops preparing entirely, waiting for the App to give her the "magic answer" or the "glitchy insight" for every client.
    *   **Day 4:** A difficult client (The Skeptic) challenges her methods. She frantically refreshes the App for a prompt.
    *   **The Glitch Escalates:** The App starts spewing gibberish code that, when read aloud, sounds phonetically like her own mother’s criticism. Or, the App turns on the front-facing camera and refuses to let her look away, overlaying filters of her looking exhausted and sad.
    *   **Day 6:** She snaps at the difficult client because the App didn't help her. She blames the "software" for the bad session.

*   **Emotional Beats:**
    *   Arrogance (I have a secret weapon).
    *   Frustration/Powerlessness when the weapon misfires.
    *   Realization that she is losing her own agency.

## Week 4: The Hard Reset (Climax & Resolution)

**Focus:** Internalizing the lesson.

*   **Key Events:**
    *   **Day 1:** The "Big Opportunity"—a corporate contract she desperately wants to prove her worth to her old peers.
    *   **The Glitch Final Form:** The morning of the pitch, the App is dead. Black screen. No battery icon. Totally bricked. She has to go in blind.
    *   **Day 3 (The Pitch):** She stands before the board. She feels naked without her "Yoda." She starts to fumble, then remembers the camera glitch (the mirror). She drops the corporate mask and speaks from her heart about failure and resilience. It resonates deeply.
    *   **Day 5:** She wins the contract, but on her own terms.
    *   **Resolution:** She returns home. The App turns on spontaneously. It displays a simple message: *"User Calibration 100%. Update Complete."* It returns to being just a normal calendar app.

*   **Emotional Beats:**
    *   Terror (The crutch is gone).
    *   Acceptance (I am enough).
    *   Peace (The tool is just a tool; the magic is the craftsman).
