She is willing to destroy priceless artifacts if it means harvesting a rare spore or viable enzyme, putting her constantly at odds with Kaelen."

Wearing a patchwork suit of mismatched pressure seals and cured bio-leather, Jax knows the sphere's geography better than anyone. He acts as a fence, trading ancient data chips to Kaelen while selling scrap coordinates to Overseer Vane, dangerously playing both sides to fund his escape. He is deeply paranoid about the 'Singing Moss' and constantly hums discordant tunes to drown out voices only he can hear."

Torren is unique because he has developed a superstitious reverence for the sphere's 'haunted' atmosphere, contrary to his orders to sanitize it. He has taken a vow of silence regarding a past military tragedy, speaking only when absolutely necessary in a tectonic rumble. Secretly, he creates intricate charcoal sketches of the biomechanical flora during his watch shifts, hiding them in his ammo pouches. His central conflict lies in his contract: he is sworn to protect the corporate interests that intend to incinerate the very beauty he has come to worship, often leading him to 'accidentally' misinterpret orders that would harm the ecosystem."
