# CH003: The Butcher's Scalpel

The silence of Sector 4-Null was a lie, of course. It was never truly silent. Beneath the groaning of settling metal and the hydraulic hiss of Vane’s distant scrappers, there was always the Hum. It lived in the walls, a subsonic thrum that vibrated in the teeth and settled like silt in the base of the skull.

Kaelen Thorne tried to ignore it. He was kneeling before a expanse of silicate-glass, a mural that stretched twenty meters high and wrapped around the curvature of the corridor. It was a masterpiece of lost history, depicting the Dyson sphere’s construction—not by machines, but by something that looked disturbingly organic. Figures wove nebula-light into strands of DNA, gardening the stars.

"Magnificent," Kaelen whispered, the word barely escaping the seal of his respirator. He adjusted the macro-lens on his datapad, capturing the fractal patterns etched into the glass. "Echo, are you logging this? The pigmentation is actually bioluminescent algae dormant in the substrate."

Beside him, Unit 734 clicked. The maintenance drone was a chaotic jumble of geometry, its original chassis splayed open like a bloomed flower to accommodate the thick, oily vines pulsing inside it. "Logging," Echo synthesized, its voice a jagged splice of three different archival recordings. "Notice: The root structure in quadrant three requires nitrogen. Suggestion: Do not trample the moss."

"We're looking at the history of a civilization, Echo. Forget the moss."

"The moss is alive," Echo retorted, a child's voice overlaid with a warning siren. " The history is... compost."

Before Kaelen could argue, the air pressure in the corridor shifted. The heavy thud of magnetic boots echoed from the lift shaft, rapid and purposeful. It wasn't the lumbering gait of Vane’s heavy lifters. This was precision.

Dr. Elara Vance swept into the corridor like a scalpel cutting through cloth. She wore a pristine white hazard suit that seemed to repel the grime of the sphere, her faceplate polarized to a mirror sheen. She didn't look at Kaelen. She didn't look at Echo. She looked straight at the mural.

"Dr. Vance," Kaelen said, standing up and brushing dust from his knees. "I wasn't expecting you until the next rotation. I haven't finished the cataloging yet, so if you could give me a—"

Vance didn't stop. She raised a handheld device that looked less like a scanner and more like a weapon. "Step aside, Thorne. You’re blocking the biologicals."

"Biologicals? This is a cultural heritage site. The narrative structure of this mural suggests—"

*HISS.*

A beam of concentrated thermal energy shot from Vance’s device. It didn't scan the wall; it incinerated it.

"No!" Kaelen lunged forward, but Echo’s metallic limb shot out, catching him by the chest plate.

"Warning," Echo chirped. "Thermal hazard. High probability of epidermal carbonization."

Kaelen watched in horror as Vance carved a crude, jagged square right through the center of the mural. The depiction of the star-gardeners shattered, the silicate glass turning to slag. She wasn't aiming for the art. She was digging for what lay behind it.

She deactivated the cutter and used a pair of tongs to pull a steaming, pulsing clump of violet fungus from the cavity she’d just made. The fungus writhed in the open air, its tendrils grasping for purchase.

"Found you," Vance murmured, her voice cool and detached over the comms. She dropped the sample into a cryo-container and sealed it with a hiss.

"You destroyed it," Kaelen stammered, his voice rising. He pointed at the smoking hole in the artwork. "You just destroyed a three-thousand-year-old primary source! For a... a mushroom?"

Vance turned to him then, de-polarizing her faceplate. Her eyes were sharp, intelligent, and utterly devoid of sentiment. "It’s a mutagenic spore, Thorne. *Cryos-7*. Capable of accelerating cellular regeneration by four hundred percent. Do you have any idea what that’s worth to the Consortium? To medicine?"

"It’s vandalism!" Kaelen shouted. "We are here to understand them, not strip-mine them!"

"We are here to survive, you dusty little man," Vance snapped, stepping closer. "You care about dead data. Ghosts. I care about living potential. If I have to burn every pretty picture in this sphere to find a cure for orbital atrophy, I will strike the match myself."

Kaelen opened his mouth to retort, to tell her that she was a barbarian, that she was no better than Vane’s scrappers.

And then the Hum spiked.

It wasn't a sound. It was a pressure, a sudden atmospheric squeeze that popped his ears and turned his vision grainy. The vibration rattled his teeth.

Kaelen froze. He looked at the woman in the white suit standing in front of him. He knew he was angry. His heart was hammering against his ribs. He knew she had done something unforgivable.

But who was she?

For a terrifying, stretched second, the file in his brain labeled 'IDENTITY' came up empty. He stared at her face—the sharp nose, the severe cut of her dark hair—and found no recognition. Was she a crewmate? An intruder?

"Well?" the woman demanded, tapping her foot. "Are you going to lecture me, or can I get back to work?"

Kaelen blinked rapidly. He felt a wave of nausea, a physical lurch as if the floor had dropped a centimeter. He looked down at his datapad, his hands trembling. *Elara Vance. Xenobiologist. Rival.*

The data rushed back in, cold and hard.

"Vance," Kaelen gasped, the name tasting like ash in his mouth. "You... you’re Vance."

Vance raised an eyebrow. "Is the oxygen mix in your suit off, Thorne? You look like you’ve seen a ghost. Which, knowing you, is probably what you’d prefer."

She turned on her heel, clutching the canister of violet sludge like a prize, and marched back toward the lift.

Kaelen stood in the ruins of the mural, the smell of ozone and burnt glass filling his helmet. The Hum receded back to its low, background thrum, innocent as a heartbeat.

"Query," Echo said, tilting its head so the optical sensors focused on Kaelen’s sweating face. "Subject: Thorne displayed signs of synaptic misfire. Duration: 10.4 seconds."

Kaelen tapped his helmet, trying to clear the static that wasn't there. He looked at the hole in the wall, then at the retreating figure of the doctor.

"I'm fine," Kaelen lied, pulling up his log. He tried to type a report on the damage, but his fingers hovered over the keys. For a moment—just a fleeting moment—he couldn't remember how to spell 'mural'.

He keyed the microphone instead. "Note," he rasped, his voice shaking. "Sector 4-Null. Interaction with Dr. Vance. Artifact destroyed. Subject experienced... momentary disorientation. Possible fatigue. End log."

He stared at the words as they transcribed onto the screen, terrified by how much effort it took to read them.
