I will start by listing the files in the parent directory to check if there are any existing book chapters or relevant content to ensure continuity, although I will primarily rely on the provided timeline. Then, I will write Chapter 5.
# CH005: The Hollow Hour

The vibrations started in the soles of Kaelen’s boots, a rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* that traveled up his shins and settled, nauseatingly, in the pit of his stomach.

"Seismic activity?" Echo asked. The drone was hovering near the ceiling of the archive chamber, its fractal lenses rotating as it scanned the intricate bas-reliefs of the upper vault. A creeping vine of metal-eating orchid had wound itself tighter around the drone's left intake vent since yesterday; Echo didn’t seem to notice, or perhaps it simply didn’t care.

"No," Kaelen muttered, pressing his hand against the cold, sweating wall of the sphere. "Corporate activity."

Somewhere above them, in the cavernous expanse of Sector 4-Null, Overseer Merrick Vane had turned on the heavy drills. The 'World-Eaters,' the crew called them. Massive, gravity-tethered excavation rigs designed to chew through alloy and bedrock to get to the juicy, conductive veins beneath.

Kaelen checked his datapad. The localized tremors were registering a magnitude of 3.2. "He’s drilling too close to the load-bearing struts. He promised me a fifty-meter buffer."

"Overseer Vane’s logic is efficient," Echo chirped. The drone’s voice synthesized a crackle of static, like a needle skipping on vinyl. "Structural integrity of Archive Node 9 is... negligible. Value of raw material: high."

"The history is the value, you scrap-heap," Kaelen snapped, though there was no heat in it. He was tired. The hum in the walls—the sphere’s natural, subsonic song—was fighting with the mechanical thumping of the drills. The dissonance made his teeth ache.

He turned back to the artifact on the table. It was a crystalline storage matrix, roughly the size of a human skull, but faceted like a insect's eye. It was pulsating faintly, reacting to the tremors.

*Thump.* Dust drifted down from the vaulted ceiling.
*Thump.* A hairline fracture appeared in the obsidian support pillar to his right.

"Kaelen," Echo said. The drone descended, its lights shifting from inquiry-blue to warning-amber. "Biometric scan detects elevated cortisol. And... the structural resonance is spiking."

"I see it." Kaelen grabbed his stylus, furiously sketching the layout of the crystal matrix. If Vane brought the roof down, he needed to know how this piece fit into the larger machine. "Just one more minute."

*THUMP.*

The world tilted.

It wasn't a figure of speech. The floor plate beneath Kaelen simply dropped three feet, shearing away from the wall with a shriek of tearing metal. The sound was deafening—a roar of ancient alloys giving up the ghost.

"Evacuate!" Echo screamed, the audio corrupted into a multi-tonal shriek.

Debris rained down—chunks of bioluminescent moss and heavy slate. The archive tower was buckling. Kaelen lunged for the crystal matrix. He couldn't let it be crushed. It was the key to the linguistics database; he was sure of it.

He got his fingers around the cold, faceted edges. The ceiling groaned, a deep, mournful sound like a dying whale. A shadow fell over him—a slab of the upper walkway, detaching, falling.

Kaelen tucked the matrix against his chest and dove for the gap under the heavy scanning table.

The impact was a physical blow to the air itself. Dust exploded. The light died.

"Echo!" Kaelen shouted, squeezing his eyes shut, curling into a ball as the sphere tried to bury him. "Echo, status!"

He waited for the crash of the slab. He waited for the crushing weight.

He waited.

And waited.

Kaelen opened his eyes.

He was standing.

He wasn't under the table. He was in the corridor, forty meters away from the archive room.

The air was still. The dust had settled into a fine, glittering layer on the floor. The emergency lights were humming a steady, low orange. The violent *thump-thump-thump* of the drills had stopped, replaced by the eerie, omnipresent silence of the sphere.

Kaelen blinked. His heart was hammering a frantic rhythm against his ribs, adrenaline flooding a body that was no longer in danger.

"Echo?" His voice was a dry croak.

"Unit 734 is present," the drone replied. It was floating serenely by a junction box, the orchid vine on its chassis blooming with a small, pale flower that hadn't been there a moment ago.

"What...?" Kaelen looked down at his hands.

He wasn't holding the crystal matrix.

His hands were empty, covered in a sticky, silver residue that smelled like ozone and crushed mint.

"How did we get here?" Kaelen asked. He looked back down the corridor. The entrance to the archive room was blocked by a massive fall of rubble. The collapse had happened. "I was under the table. The slab was falling."

"That event occurred fifty-eight minutes ago," Echo said.

Kaelen felt the blood drain from his face. "Fifty-eight minutes?"

"Affirmative. You successfully navigated the collapse. You secured the priority asset. You then proceeded to this corridor and engaged in... cataloging."

"Cataloging?" Kaelen spun around. "Cataloging what? I don't remember any of that. I remember the dust. I remember the dark."

"You were highly focused," Echo said. The drone tilted, its lights flickering. "You requested silence."

Kaelen fumbled for his datapad, clipped to his belt. He woke the screen. "Show me the logs. Show me the last hour."

The screen flickered to life. The timestamp confirmed it: 14:00 hours. The collapse had started at 13:02.

He scrolled to the entry for 13:30.

There was no text. No diagrams. No audio notes.

The screen was filled with a drawing. It was a single, continuous line, spiraling inward, over and over, tight and frantic, digging into the digital canvas until the stylus pressure had maxed out the sensor. A black, jagged vortex.

Underneath the spiral, in a handwriting that was barely legible as his own, were three words:

*IT ATE THEM.*

Kaelen dropped the pad. It clattered loudly on the deck.

"Echo," Kaelen whispered, staring at the silver slime on his hands. "What is this? What am I holding?"

"You discarded the object four minutes ago," Echo stated. "You claimed it was 'too loud.'"

"Discarded *what*? The crystal?"

"Negative. The seed."

Kaelen looked at the rubble blocking the archive. Through a gap in the stone, high up near the ceiling, he saw a flash of yellow hazard movement.

A figure was climbing *over* the rubble, moving from the collapse zone toward the deeper, restricted shafts of the sphere.

Dr. Elara Vance.

She wasn't running from the disaster. She was using the noise, the dust, and the confusion to slip past the security perimeter Vane had established. She was heading down.

"She knew," Kaelen breathed. The gap in his memory throbbed, a dull ache behind his eyes. The hum of the sphere seemed to pitch up, just for a second, sharp and mocking.

He looked at the spiral on his datapad again.

"Echo," Kaelen said, his voice trembling. "Record this. Time: 14:05. Subject: Temporal discontinuity. I... I lost an hour. I don't know what I did."

"Recorded," Echo said. "Shall we proceed to the mess hall? You expressed hunger during the event."

"No," Kaelen wiped the silver slime onto his trousers. He grabbed his datapad. "We're following Vance."
