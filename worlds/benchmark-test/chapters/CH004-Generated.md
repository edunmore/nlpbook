# CH004: The Pruning

The silence of Sector 4-Null was a lie. It was a heavy, textured thing, woven from the subsonic thrum of the ventilation shafts and the wet, shifting sounds of the orchids growing in the dark.

Kaelen Thorne sat cross-legged on the metallic grating of what used to be a promenade. His datapad cast a sickly blue glow over his face, illuminating the dark circles under his eyes. Day 10. The deadline was a physical weight in his chest, tighter than his vac-suit’s collar.

"Status report on the decryption," Kaelen muttered, rubbing his temples. The headache was back—a dull, rhythmic pressure behind his eyes that synced perfectly with the hum in the walls.

Unit 734, 'Echo', hovered a few feet away. The fractal drone was a mess of brass clockwork and translucent, vein-like roots. The biomechanical flora had claimed nearly forty percent of its chassis now, pulsing with a faint bioluminescence.

"Processing," Echo chimed. Its voice was a patchwork of static and synthesized tones, layered over the sound of wind chimes. "Audio reconstruction at ninety-eight percent. The syntax is... archaic. Pre-Unification dialect."

Kaelen leaned forward, ignoring the throb in his head. "Play it. Let’s hear what they were so afraid of."

Echo’s optical lenses spun, focusing on the empty air between them. A hologram flickered into existence—a waveform, jagged and red. The audio crackled, then cleared. It wasn't a formal log; it was a breathless whisper.

*“…sealed. They sealed the bulkheads. Not to keep the void out. To keep us in.”*

A pause. The sound of heavy, wet coughing.

*“The bloom is accelerating. Protocol 7... it wasn't a containment measure. It was a pruning. They aren't sending rescue. They sent the pathogen. If you find this... burn it. Burn us all. Don't let the spores—”*

The audio cut to a high-pitched screech before dying out completely.

Kaelen sat frozen. The cold of the grating seeped through his suit. "A pruning," he whispered. The word tasted like ash. "This wasn't an evacuation. It was an extermination."

He looked around the vast, overgrown promenade. The towering statues of the sphere’s architects, draped in moss, suddenly looked less like monuments and more like tombstones. Vane wasn't just scrapping a ruin; he was bulldozing a crime scene.

"Echo, save that file. Encrypt it. Level 5 security."

"Acknowledged," Echo whirred. "File archived. Designation: The Pruning."

Kaelen stood up, pacing the small perimeter of their camp. His heart hammered against his ribs. This changed everything. If the Consortium knew—if Vane knew—that the sphere was a biological weapon containment site, their presence here was infinitely more dangerous.

"We need to find the source of that transmission," Kaelen said, his mind racing. "If there are more logs, we can prove the site’s historical significance holds a warning. Vane can't ignore a planetary hazard classification."

He turned back to the drone. "Echo, scan the metadata. Can you pinpoint the recording location?"

Echo drifted slightly to the left, its internal gyros whining. "Scanning. Triangulating signal origin... Sector 4-Null, Subsection Delta. The hydroponics tower."

Kaelen nodded, grabbing his stylus. He scribbled the location onto his physical notepad, the paper crinkling under his anxious grip. "Good. We move at 0600. If we can recover the flight recorder from that sector, we might have a case to halt the demolition."

He sat back down, staring at the datapad. The revelation gnawed at him. A pruning. He imagined the panic, the betrayal.

A minute passed. The hum in the walls seemed to swell, pressing against his eardrums.

Kaelen frowned, shaking his head to clear the fog. He looked up at Echo.

"Status report on the decryption," Kaelen muttered, rubbing his temples. The headache was back—a dull, rhythmic pressure behind his eyes.

Echo didn't move. Its lenses remained fixed on him.

"Processing," Echo chimed. The tone was identical to before. "Audio reconstruction at ninety-eight percent. The syntax is... archaic. Pre-Unification dialect."

Kaelen blinked. A wave of déjà vu washed over him, nauseating and intense. "Wait. You just said that."

"Play it," Kaelen heard himself say, though he hadn't moved his lips. No, wait—he *had* said it. Or was he thinking it?

"Let’s hear what they were so afraid of," he finished, the words tumbling out on autopilot.

Echo’s lenses spun. The hologram flickered. The red waveform appeared.

*“…sealed. They sealed the bulkheads...”*

Kaelen scrambled backward, kicking his datapad. "Stop! Echo, terminate playback!"

The audio cut instantly. The silence that followed was heavy, suffocating.

"Query?" Echo asked, tilting its chassis. The bioluminescent roots inside it pulsed slowly.

"We... we just did this," Kaelen stammered, his breath coming in short gasps. He looked down at his hands; they were shaking. He looked at his notepad.

There, in fresh ink, were the words: *Subsection Delta. Hydroponics.*

He stared at the handwriting. He didn't remember writing it. He remembered *intending* to write it. He remembered the conversation leading up to it. But the act itself? Gone.

"Echo," Kaelen whispered, terror pooling in his gut. "How long has it been since you first played that log?"

"Time interval: Twelve minutes, forty-three seconds," Echo replied.

Twelve minutes. He had been sitting there, trapped in a loop, having the same reaction, making the same plan, while the sphere chewed away at his short-term memory.

Kaelen looked at the pen in his hand. He gripped it until his knuckles turned white. He flipped the page, ignoring the tremor in his fingers, and wrote in large, block letters:

**DO NOT TRUST THE SILENCE. YOU ARE LOOPING.**

He stared at the words until they burned into his retinas. The hum in the walls purred, satisfied.
