# CH002: The Broken Guide

The silence in Sector 4-Null was heavy, a physical weight that pressed against Kaelen Thorne’s eardrums. It wasn't true silence, of course. It never was. Underneath the groan of settling metal and the rustle of the biomechanical ferns, there was the hum.

It was a low frequency, hovering just at the edge of perception. Kaelen felt it in his teeth more than he heard it. It tasted like copper and old electricity.

He wiped sweat from his forehead with the back of a gloved hand, leaving a streak of grey dust across his brow. He was three meters deep in a root system that had once been a ventilation shaft. The flora here was aggressive; cables of green and chrome twisted together, pulsing with a faint, bioluminescent rhythm. They didn't just grow over the architecture; they interrogated it, prying apart plates to taste the circuitry beneath.

"Careful," Kaelen whispered to no one.

He was using a micro-laser scalpel to excise a particularly stubborn root from a metallic casing. He wasn't sure what he had found yet, but the geometry was distinct. Fractal patterns. Recursive triangles etched into a chassis of matte-black alloy. This wasn't structural; it was a machine.

Overseer Vane would have used a plasma torch. *Cut the weed, melt the scrap, move on.* The thought made Kaelen’s grip on the scalpel tighten. Vane saw a graveyard to be looted. Kaelen saw a library to be read.

With a final, delicate severing of the plant fiber, the object shifted. Kaelen holstered the scalpel and braced his boots against the shaft walls. He pulled.

The object came free with a sound like a wet gasp.

Kaelen stumbled back, catching his balance against a moss-covered conduit. He shone his headlamp on the prize.

It was a drone. Or, the upper torso of one. It was shaped like a teardrop, its surface a mesmerizing landscape of shifting geometric plates. But it was ruined. A thick, purple orchid had burst through the central sensor array, its petals splayed open like a gory wound. The roots didn't just pierce the metal; they seemed to be woven into the motherboard, replacing burnt-out capacitors with fleshy nodes.

"Unit 734," Kaelen read the faded serial stamp near the base. "Maintenance class. Or... was maintenance."

He set the drone down on a flat section of the floor. By all rights, it should be dead. The orchid had consumed half its power core. But as Kaelen ran his scanner over the chassis, the readout spiked.

*Energy signature: 12%. Source: Biological.*

"You're eating it," Kaelen murmured, leaning closer. "Or it's eating you."

He pulled a universal interface cable from his belt. It was obsolete tech, something he’d scavenged from a junk market on Mars, but it was the only thing compatible with the sphere's pre-Collapse ports. He found the input jack under a flap of synthetic skin and plugged in.

His datapad flickered. A stream of garbage code scrolled down the screen—corrupted headers, fragmented audio files, weather data from a thousand years ago.

Then, the drone twitched.

The geometric plates on its chassis rippled, reconfiguring themselves. The purple orchid in its center pulsed, its bioluminescence flaring from dim violet to angry neon.

A sound tore from the drone’s speaker—a screech of static that resolved into a voice. But it wasn't a single voice. It was a choir of ghosts, spliced together.

*"Warning. Atmospheric pressure..."* a woman’s voice began, crisp and professional, before glitching into a deep, guttural bass. *"...is delicious. The nitrogen tastes of..."* It snapped again, now a child’s whisper. *"...Sector 4. Pruning required."*

Kaelen took a step back, heart hammering. "Unit 734. Report status."

The drone levitated. It didn't use thrusters; it simply ignored gravity, floating up until it was eye-level with Kaelen. The orchid acted as its eye, the petals twitching like an iris.

*"Status is..."* The drone tilted its chassis. *"Flowering. I am Unit 734. Designation: Echo."*

"Echo," Kaelen tested the name. "You've been down here a long time, Echo."

*"Time,"* Echo said, the voice shifting to that of an old man, weary and cracked. *"Time is root depth. We are very deep."*

Kaelen reached for his mag-stylus to take a note. This was unprecedented. A symbiotic fusion of the sphere’s technology and the invasive flora. It proved his theory that the ecosystem wasn't just growing on the ruins; it was adapting to them.

He reached for his belt pouch.

Empty.

Kaelen frowned, patting his hip. He looked at the ground. He must have dropped the stylus when he pulled the drone free. He scanned the floor, the beam of his headlamp cutting through the gloom. Nothing but dust and severed root fibers.

"Damn it," he muttered. He checked his chest pockets. Nothing. He checked the floor again, widening his search. He knew he had it. He had used it to mark the excavation site coordinates not ten minutes ago.

Panic, cold and sharp, pricked at his chest. It wasn't about the stylus. It was the lapse. He was meticulous. He didn't lose tools.

"Looking for the scribe-stick?" Echo asked. The voice was now a digitized synthesized tone, flat and robotic.

"My stylus," Kaelen snapped, overturning a piece of scrap metal. "Yes. Did you see it?"

*"You are holding it."*

Kaelen froze.

He looked down. His right hand was clenched in a fist. He opened it. The silver mag-stylus lay across his palm, warm from his own body heat.

He stared at it. The metal seemed foreign, like an object teleported into his hand from another dimension. He remembered searching the floor. He remembered the frustration. He did *not* remember picking it up. He didn't remember holding it while he searched for it.

"I..." Kaelen swallowed. The hum in the walls seemed to swell, a resonant thrum that vibrated in his molars. "I must be tired. The descent took more out of me than I thought."

Echo drifted closer, the purple orchid turning to face him. The petals shifted, and for a second, Kaelen thought the plant was sniffing him.

*"Fatigue,"* Echo said, using the child’s voice again. It sounded mocking. *"Yes. The hum is loud today. It tries to write over the bad sectors."*

"Bad sectors?" Kaelen pocketed the stylus, making sure the flap clicked shut. He needed to sleep. Just a few hours. "What do you mean?"

*"The memories,"* Echo replied. *"The ones that don't fit the garden."*

The drone spun in the air, a lazy, impossible rotation.

*"Mind the quiet, archaeologist. When the noise stops, that means it’s finished erasing."*

Kaelen stared at the machine, then at the dark, overgrown corridor stretching out behind it. The hum droned on, constant, unwavering.

He pulled out his datapad and opened a new file.
*Subject: Unit 734 'Echo'. Condition: Unstable. Anomaly: Symbiotic integration with local flora.*

He hesitated, his thumb hovering over the screen. He thought about the stylus in his hand. The ten minutes of searching for something he was already holding.

He typed: *Self-Diagnostic: Mild dehydration. Cognitive function nominal.*

He deleted the last sentence.

*Cognitive function: Strained.*

"Come on," Kaelen said, his voice sounding too loud in the cramped shaft. "Let's get you back to camp. Vane is going to want to scrap you, so try to look... indispensable."

*"Scrap,"* Echo repeated. The word came out as a sound of tearing metal. *"We shall see who is pruned first."*
