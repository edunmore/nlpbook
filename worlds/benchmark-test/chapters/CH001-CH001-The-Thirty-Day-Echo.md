# CH001: The Thirty-Day Echo

The descent into Sector 4-Null was less a flight and more a slow-motion fall into the throat of a mechanical god. 

Kaelen Thorne pressed his forehead against the reinforced glass of the transport’s viewing port. Below, the inner shell of the Dyson sphere curved upward into an impossible horizon, a landscape of rusted alloys and shimmering, iridescent moss. It was a world turned inside out. Here, the "sky" was the distant, flickering heart of a captive star, and the ground was a crust of ancient engineering overgrown by the sphere’s own runaway biology.

His thumb traced the leather binding of his physical notebook—a relic in an age of neural links, but Kaelen didn't trust the stability of the local network. He liked the weight of ink. He liked that paper didn't have a signal that could be intercepted or erased.

"Stunning, isn't it?"

The voice was like the grinding of tectonic plates. Kaelen didn't need to turn to know it was Overseer Merrick Vane. The man’s shadow, elongated by the harsh star-glow, was distorted by the bulky, angular protrusions of his military-grade cybernetics.

"It’s a graveyard, Overseer," Kaelen replied softly. "A beautiful, silent graveyard."

"It’s a resource, Thorne. Don't let the xeno-archaeology degree cloud your vision." Vane stepped up beside him, the servos in his neck whining with a high-pitched, predatory precision. He pointed a metallic finger at a cluster of towering, crystalline structures choked by dark, pulsing vines. "The Stellar Consortium sees twelve trillion credits of refined isotope in those pylons. My job is to make sure they get it."

"And my job is to ensure you don't incinerate the history of the most advanced civilization in the sector while you're at it."

Vane let out a dry, rattling laugh. "You have thirty days. That’s the window before the heavy-lift liquidators arrive. Thirty days to tag your 'sentimental garbage.' Anything not in a crate by then gets melted down for the war effort. Am I clear?"

Kaelen looked at the clock on his datapad. *29:23:59:58.* The numbers were red, bleeding into the digital display like an open wound. "Perfectly."

The transport settled onto a landing platform that groaned under the weight. As the pressurized seal hissed open, a wave of thick, humid air rushed in. It smelled of ozone, wet copper, and something sweet—the cloying scent of the metal-eating orchids that draped from every overhead strut.

And then, there was the Hum.

It wasn't a sound so much as a pressure behind Kaelen’s eyes. A subsonic vibration that seemed to harmonize with the marrow in his bones. It was the sphere’s heartbeat, erratic and ancient.

Kaelen stepped onto the platform, his boots clanking on the honeycomb grating. He pulled out his datapad to log his initial impressions, his fingers moving with obsessive speed.

*Entry 001: Sector 4-Null. Atmospheric density is higher than expected. The biomechanical flora appears to be in a growth spurt, likely triggered by the heat of our approach. The hum is persistent. Subsonic. Possible neurological—*

He stopped. He blinked. 

He looked at the screen of his datapad.

Kaelen frowned. He felt a strange, fleeting sensation, like a sneeze that had vanished before it could arrive. He read the paragraph again.

"Wait," he whispered. 

He had just read that. Or had he? He felt certain he had reached the end of the sentence, but as his eyes moved across the text, the information felt brand new. It was as if his brain was a sieve, and the words were water.

"Thorne! Moving out!" Vane shouted from the edge of the platform, his heavy footsteps echoing through the hollow shell.

Kaelen shook his head, a cold shiver racing down his spine. He looked at the orchids nearby. Their petals, translucent and veined with glowing fiber-optics, seemed to pulse in time with the hum. 

He reached into his pocket and gripped his pen so hard his knuckles turned white. He didn't look at the datapad again. Instead, he opened his physical notebook and wrote one word in jagged, heavy strokes:

**WATCH.**

The clock was ticking, and for the first time in his career, Kaelen Thorne wasn't sure if he could trust the one thing an archaeologist needed most: his own memory.
