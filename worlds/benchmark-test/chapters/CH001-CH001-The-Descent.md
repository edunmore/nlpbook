# CH001: The Descent

The silence of a Dyson sphere wasn’t empty; it was heavy. It pressed against the hull of the shuttle like deep-ocean water, a physical weight composed of three thousand years of accumulated dust and dead starlight.

Kaelen Thorne adjusted the strap of his satchel, feeling the reassuring crinkle of his physical notebook against his hip. Digital logs could be corrupted, batteries could die, but graphite on paper was an obstinate witness. Through the viewport, Sector 4-Null stretched out—a continent-sized plate of the sphere’s inner shell. It should have been a sterile expanse of circuitry and solar collectors. Instead, it looked like a garden grown in a graveyard.

Biomechanical vines, thick as transit tunnels, choked the mega-structures. They pulsed with a faint, sickly bioluminescence, weaving through the shattered ribs of skyscrapers that hung upside down from the sphere’s curvature.

"Touchdown in T-minus two," the pilot announced, his voice bored. He was a corporate contractor, just like everyone else on this expedition. To him, this wasn’t the greatest archaeological find of the millennium; it was a salvage run.

Kaelen checked his datapad for the tenth time. *Sector 4-Null. Primary habitation ring. Preliminary scans indicate 94% structural integrity despite organic intrusion.*

The shuttle shuddered as the landing clamps engaged with the docking arm. Kaelen waited for the hiss of the airlock, taking a breath that tasted of recycled air and stale coffee. He was the first xeno-archaeologist to set foot in this sector. He was likely the last.

The airlock cycled. Kaelen stepped out onto the rusted gantry, and the smell hit him instantly—ozone and rotting orchids. The air was breathable, maintained by the very plants that were eating the station, but it sat thick in the lungs.

"Thorne."

The voice was a grinder striking steel. Kaelen turned to see Overseer Merrick Vane waiting at the end of the walkway. Vane was a towering figure, half-man, half-siege weapon. His left arm was replaced by a multi-tool loader claw, currently folded into a resting position, and his right eye was a red optical sensor that whirred as it focused on Kaelen.

"Overseer," Kaelen nodded, keeping his voice neutral. He hated the Stellar Consortium, but he needed their permit.

Vane didn't offer a hand; he barely offered a glance. He turned and began walking, his heavy magnetic boots clanking rhythmically on the deck. Kaelen had to jog slightly to keep up.

"You’re late," Vane rumbled over his shoulder. "Schedule says you were boots-on-ground at 0800. It’s 0812."

"Turbulence in the upper atmosphere," Kaelen excused, scanning the corridor. The walls here were coated in a velvet-like moss that seemed to absorb the light from the overhead strips. "The flora creates thermal pockets."

"The *weeds*," Vane corrected, stopping abruptly in front of a heavy blast door. He spun around, the servos in his neck whining. "Let’s be clear about the parameters of your contract, Dr. Thorne. You are here to tag items of 'significant cultural value.' You are not here to map the place. You are not here to study the ecosystem."

Vane leaned in, the red eye narrowing. "You are here because legal requires a heritage audit before we start the melt. You have thirty days."

"Thirty days?" Kaelen blinked. "Overseer, this sector is the size of a moon. Thirty days isn't enough to catalog a single city block, let alone—"

"Thirty days," Vane repeated, his voice dropping an octave. "Then my scrappers move in. Anything you haven’t tagged goes into the furnace. This sphere is a liability, Thorne. It’s dead weight on the Consortium’s balance sheet. I’m here to turn it into credits."

He slammed his flesh hand against the door control. The blast doors groaned open, revealing the cavernous atrium beyond. "Don't get in my way, and try not to get eaten by the plants. Welcome to 4-Null."

Vane marched off towards a cluster of portable floodlights and heavy machinery being set up in the distance. Kaelen watched him go, a knot of anxiety tightening in his chest. Thirty days. It was a desecration.

He turned his attention to the atrium. It was magnificent. Statues of the sphere's creators—tall, slender humanoids with multiple joints in their arms—lined the walls. But the vines had decapitated some, bound others in crushing embraces.

Kaelen pulled out his physical notebook. He needed to start immediately.

*Day 1,* he wrote. *Arrival. Vane is hostile. Sector condition: heavily overgrown. Architecture suggests late-dynastic period of the Builders. The synthesis of organic and inorganic is more advanced than previous sectors.*

He stopped. A sound teased the edge of his hearing.

It wasn't a noise, exactly. It was a vibration, a subsonic thrum that vibrated in his teeth and behind his eyes. It felt like the station itself was purring.

*Hum in the walls,* he noted. *Likely power coupling instability or ventilation resonance.*

He looked up at a mural halfway up the wall. It depicted a star being enclosed by the sphere, the Builders holding hands in a circle around it. He raised his datapad to scan the pigment composition.

The device beeped. *Composition: Iron oxide, silicate, unknown fungal spore.*

Kaelen frowned. That was odd. He tapped the screen to read the spectral analysis again.

*Composition: Iron oxide, silicate, unknown fungal spore.*

He nodded. Standard pigments. He looked back at the mural. The beauty of the brushstrokes was haunting. He looked down at his datapad to check the age estimate.

The device beeped. *Composition: Iron oxide, silicate, unknown fungal spore.*

Kaelen paused. Why had he scanned it again?

He shook his head, a sudden wave of dizziness washing over him. The hum seemed to swell for a microsecond, a sharp spike of pressure in his temples, before fading back to the background thrum.

He looked at his datapad. The screen was still displaying the spectral analysis. He must have double-clicked the scan button. Fatigue, he told himself. The descent had been rough, and the gravity adjustment was always disorienting.

"Focus, Kaelen," he whispered to himself. The acoustics of the atrium carried his voice, returning it to him as a hollow, metallic echo.

He looked down at his physical notebook to log the mural's location.

*Day 1. Arrival. Vane is hostile.*

He stared at the page. The graphite was smudged where his hand had rested. He read the last line he had written.

*Hum in the walls. Likely power coupling instability or ventilation resonance.*

He frowned. He didn't remember writing that sentence. He remembered *thinking* it. He remembered hearing the sound. But the act of writing it down felt... absent. Like a frame of film cut from a reel.

Kaelen touched the paper. The graphite was fresh. He looked around the empty atrium. The statues stared back blindly. The biomechanical vines pulsed slowly, a soft, rhythmic bioluminescence that matched the tempo of the vibration in the floor.

It was just the stress. Thirty days to save history. Of course he was rattled.

Kaelen clipped the pen to the notebook and snapped it shut. He needed to set up his base camp before he started seeing ghosts. He walked deeper into the hall, the sound of his own footsteps feeling strangely disconnected, as if he were following himself from a few seconds behind.

Deep in the walls, the hum continued—patient, steady, and hungry.
