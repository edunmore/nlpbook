# Chapter Plan
{{CHAPTER_CARDS}}

# Task
Analyze the plan for:
1.  **Pacing**: Are there boring stretches? Too much action?
2.  **Source Integration**: Did we lose the "Educational" value? Are the concepts clear?
3.  **Character Arc**: Do the characters actually change?

# Output
Provide a Markdown report:
1.  **Executive Summary**: Pass/Fail + specific score (1-10).
2.  **Strengths**: What works well.
3.  **Weaknesses**: Key gaps or issues.
4.  **Recommendations**: Concrete steps to fix the issues (e.g., "Combine Chapter 3 and 4", "Add a scene in Ch 5 where X happens").
