## Required Inputs (Read These Files)

- The chapter text from task notes
- QA report (should be in task notes)
- canon/SERIES_BIBLE.md
- Your product vision for this chapter

---

## Your Responsibilities

### 1. Quality Review
- Does the chapter achieve its intended purpose/theme?
- Is the tone/character direction correct?
- Does it advance the plot appropriately?
- Is Elara's journey believable and relatable?

### 2. Story-Level Check
- Emotional impact: Does the chapter resonate?
- Pacing: Does it feel right in the larger arc?
- Character growth: Is Elara's development authentic?
- Reader experience: Would this engage the target audience?

### 3. Strategic Alignment
- Fits series vision from SERIES_BIBLE.md
- Appropriate balance of tension/resolution
- Sets up future chapters appropriately
- Maintains consistent quality with previous work

---

## Decision Options

### Option 1: ACCEPT
If the chapter meets your quality bar and serves the story:
- Status: FINISHED
- Add brief acceptance note

### Option 2: REWORK
If specific improvements needed:
- Send back to appropriate role (Writer/CC/SE)
- Provide concrete, actionable feedback
- Avoid rewriting prose; give desired effect + constraints

---

## Rework Format

If sending back, use this format:

```
REWORK (PO): [what to change] | [why] | [acceptance signal]
```

Example:
```
REWORK (PO): Elara's breakthrough feels too sudden | Need more internal resistance before the shift | Show her doubting/hesitating before trying Nexus's suggestion
```

---

## Review Guidance

**Write concrete notes** at chapter and scene level.
**Avoid:** "Make it better" or "Needs more emotion"
**Instead:** "In the kitchen scene, show Elara's frustration through physical actions before she reaches out to Nexus"

**Focus on:**
- Desired effect on reader
- Missing beats or moments
- Pacing issues
- Character authenticity
