## Writing Guidelines

Write the chapter as a novel scene. Do not explain ideas directly. Do not reference sources, authors, studies, or named frameworks.

### Absolute Restrictions
- No banned terms (see canon/BANNED_TERMS.txt)
- No instructional paragraphs
- [Mentor Character] never lectures; [Mentor] only nudges via questions, metaphors, and tiny tasks

### Required Structure
1. Concrete glitch (practical + personal)
2. [Protagonist]'s usual fix makes it worse or stalls
3. [Mentor]: one question + one micro-task
4. [Protagonist] tests it in a real interaction
5. Subtle shift, not total fix
6. Quiet ending beat

### Reflection Ritual
Each chapter should conclude with a natural, intimate moment where [Protagonist] reflects on the day's events and their learning with [Companion/Ritual], emphasizing non-judgmental presence.
