# Style Rules (Canon)

## Voice
- Close third-person, primarily [Protagonist]’s perspective.
- Precise, reflective. No melodrama.
- Show through action, dialogue, physical cues, and consequences.

## Absolute restrictions
- Do not mention any named frameworks, schools, authors, studies, or technical/academic/coaching/psychology terminology.
- No instructional paragraphs. No “the lesson is…”. No end-of-chapter summary/moral.
- [Mentor Character] never lectures. They nudge via questions, metaphors, and tiny tasks.

## Chapter structure (required)
1) Concrete glitch in [Protagonist]’s day (practical + personal).
2) [Protagonist] applies their usual fix; it worsens or stalls.
3) [Mentor] offers one question + one micro-task.
4) [Protagonist] tests it in a real interaction.
5) Subtle shift; not a total fix.
6) Quiet ending beat / Reflection.

## Ending block (required)
Every chapter ends with:
---
SERIES MEMORY UPDATE (for author use)
- Purpose/Theme: [One sentence summary of the shift/lesson]
- bullet facts only
