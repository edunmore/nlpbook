# Recurring Motifs (Optional)

Use 1–2 per chapter for cohesion:
- [Motif 1]
- [Motif 2]
- [Motif 3]

## The [Specific Ritual Name]
Most chapters end with a quiet scene:
1.  **Setting:** [Where does the protagonist go to decompress?]
2.  **Action:** [What small ritual helps them ground themselves?]
3.  **Dialogue:** [Who do they talk to? A pet? A partner? Themselves?]
4.  **Contrast:** [How does this provide contrast to the chaotic main plot?]
