# Working Agreements

- Use backlog.md task status as the single source of truth for “where work is.”
- Always append notes; do not overwrite unless intentionally replacing the full draft.
- When sending back for rework:
  - move to previous role’s `Doing`,
  - set assignee,
  - append a `REWORK (<ROLE>): ...` note.
- Keep chapters cohesive by honoring canon files in `canon/`.
- Prefer small, targeted edits over broad rewrites during Style/QA.
