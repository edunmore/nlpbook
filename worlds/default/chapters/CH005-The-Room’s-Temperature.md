# CH005: The Room’s Temperature

The Tuesday sync was usually a formality, but today the air in the conference room felt like a refrigerator.

"The dashboard metrics are off," Jonah said, tossing a stapled packet onto the table. "Marketing needs these numbers for the campaign, and they're wrong."

Elara looked at the packet. "They aren't wrong, Jonah. They're raw data. You're asking for interpreted analytics, which we haven't built yet because we're focusing on database stability."

"I don't care about the database," Jonah snapped. "I care that I look like an idiot in front of the VP."

Ben crossed his arms. "If we pull resources to build a custom dashboard now, we risk the migration timeline."

"And if we don't have the metrics, the launch is blind," Jonah countered.

The silence that followed was thick and cold. Elara could feel the walls going up—Ben retreating into technical obstinance, Jonah sharpening his political knives. Her own instinct was to pull rank, to cite the architectural roadmap and shut down the request.

*Ping.*

**Nexus:** *The temperature is dropping.*

**Elara:** *Jonah is being unreasonable.*

**Nexus:** *He is blocked. A blocked system freezes.*

**Elara:** *So I should just build him a dashboard?*

**Nexus:** *Experiment 005.*
**Nexus:** *Context:* Deadlock.
**Nexus:** *Inquiry:* Find the common ground.
**Nexus:** *Task:* Don't defend. Ask a question that assumes the answer is already "Yes, if..."

Elara frowned at the screen. A question that assumes the answer.

She looked at Jonah. He was tapping his pen again, that erratic, anxious rhythm. He wasn't trying to sabotage the project; he was trying to survive his own meeting.

"Jonah," Elara said. Her voice was level.

He looked up, expecting a fight. "What?"

"How can we give you the numbers you need without pulling engineering off the migration?"

Jonah blinked. He opened his mouth to argue, then closed it. The question had trapped him—but in a useful way. It accepted his need (numbers) and her constraint (migration) as valid facts, then asked for a bridge.

"I..." Jonah frowned. "I don't need a live dashboard. I just need a snapshot for the slide deck."

"A snapshot," Ben said, uncrossing his arms. "I can run a SQL query and dump it to CSV. Takes five minutes."

Jonah looked at Ben. "You can?"

"Yeah. I'll email it to you after this meeting."

"Oh," Jonah said. The tension went out of his shoulders. "Okay. That works."

The temperature in the room seemed to rise ten degrees. The refrigerator hum was replaced by the low buzz of collaboration.

***

That evening, the rain drummed against the windowpane. Elara sat in her favorite armchair, a book open but unread on her lap.

Patch jumped up, his paws sinking into the blanket. He sniffed her hand, checking for stress, then curled up and rested his chin on her wrist.

"It was just one sentence, Patch," Elara whispered.

Patch flicked an ear, listening.

"I stopped fighting the cold," she said. "I just... asked the room to warm up."

Patch purred, a warm, vibrating affirmation against her pulse. He stretched out a paw, covering her hand with his, as if sealing the deal.

"Simple," Elara murmured, closing her eyes.

SERIES MEMORY UPDATE
- **Purpose/Theme:** To show that asking a directed question that validates both sides' needs (presupposing a solution exists) lowers defenses and resolves conflict better than arguing.
- **Event:** Tuesday Sync meeting regarding marketing metrics.
- **Glitch:** Jonah demands a dashboard; Ben/Elara defend the roadmap; deadlock ensues.
- **Nexus Intervention:** Experiment 005 - Directed Questioning / Ask a question that presumes the solution.
- **Shift:** Elara asks "How can we give you X without Y?" leading to a simple compromise (CSV export) instead of a feature build.
- **Characters:** Jonah accepts a smaller solution when his underlying need is met; Ben volunteers a quick fix.
- **Open Loops:** Ben's willingness to help is growing.
