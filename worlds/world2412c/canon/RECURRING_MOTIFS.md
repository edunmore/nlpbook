# Recurring Motifs (Optional)

Use 1–2 per chapter for cohesion:
- Cursor blinking / terminal glow
- Elevator silence
- Coffee/tea cooling
- Glass walls and reflections
- Patch on warm hardware
- A micro-pause before replying
- A widened gaze that changes the room
- A small unsent message

## The Patch Ritual
Most chapters end with a quiet scene at home:
1.  **Setting:** Elara decompressing (floor, couch, nook).
2.  **Action:** Patch seeks warmth/connection.
3.  **Dialogue:** Elara vocalizes the chapter’s lesson to Patch.
4.  **Contrast:** Patch responds with simple, grounded "cat-ness" (purring, sleeping, indifference), grounding Elara’s complex abstract thoughts.
