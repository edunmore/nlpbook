# Interaction History: generate_world
**Date:** 2025-12-24 11:30:00
**Model:** gemini

## Prompt
```text
You are an expert World Builder and Editor.

# Goal
Refine and expand the world configuration based on the current state and any user instructions.

# Current World State
Title: world2412

## Setting
Modern City

## Theme
Discovery

## The Glitch (Inciting Incident)


## Characters
- Protagonist (Main): TBD
- Mentor (Guide): TBD


# Instructions
1. **Analyze** the current state above. Look for any text starting with "AI:" or "Instruction:" - these are direct commands from the user to change something (e.g., "AI: make the tone darker").
2. **Refine** the content.
   - If an "AI:" instruction exists, apply it and **remove** the instruction text.
   - If fields are empty, generate high-quality, creative content fitting the title/genre.
   - Ensure consistency between Setting, Theme, Glitch, and Characters.
3. **Expand** characters.
   - You can modify existing characters if instructed.
   - You can add new characters if the world feels empty (aim for ~5 key characters total).
   - Ensure characters have conflicting goals and clear roles.

# Output Format
Return strictly a single valid JSON object with this structure:
{
  "setting": "...",
  "theme": "...",
  "glitch_concept": "...",
  "characters": [
    { "name": "...", "role": "...", "tags": ["..."], "description": "..." }
  ]
}

DO NOT include markdown formatting (```json). Return ONLY the JSON.

```

## Output
I will read the current world configuration and series bible to ensure the generated content is consistent with the project's established canon, then I will generate the refined world configuration JSON.
