## Prompt
```text
You are a literary scout and concept analyst.
You have been given short excerpts from multiple source files. 
Your goal is to identify which files contain the most "original", "dense", or "thematically unique" NLP concepts suitable for a story titled "FixedWorld".

# Story Context
**Theme**: The Silent Language of Structure. The storyline focuses on the disconnect between Helena's intellectual expertise and the messy reality of human emotion. As she takes on her first client, the narrative explores how the AI WATCH teaches her to read the 'source code' of human experience—posture, breathing, and linguistic patterns—without ever explicitly naming them as NLP. It is a journey from trying to force change through logic to facilitating change through observation and rapport.
**Setting**: Helena operates internationally, splitting her time between her hometown of Shanghai and a small, picturesque town in Germany. Her goal is to build a life that seamlessly bridges these two cultures while pursuing a new career in transformational coaching, leaving behind the rigid structure of the corporate world.

Welcome to Advanced Neurodynamics NLP Master Practitioner Training. You are in for a really wonderful experience as you join us for this live training. As you join us, perhaps you could imagine you are right with us in the training. Now let's join Dr. Tad James live in Kona.

All right, welcome. This is our NLP Master Practitioner Training, and I want to welcome you guys to Kona. If you're listening on the tapes, welcome. What I want to say is that this is, I think this is real exciting for me because what I do is I get to teach an entire Master practitioner training, and I get to share with you some of my thoughts about NLP, of which I haven't done an entire one of these for a while. So I get to re-look at the content and really once again get into it.

And there are some things I think which are very important about neuro-linguistic programming which are not immediately obvious. So what I'd like to do, if I may, oh, and I want to w

So just for a second, what I'd like you to do is noticing when you're in that state, what happens to your focus? What happens to your focus? When you go into that state, when you go into that state, what happens to your focus? Murray? It's blurred in a sense, and yet I'm aware of much more at the same time, even though centrally I'm not really seeing so clearly as normal, and yet I'm taking in everything in the room.

It's easy. Yeah, yeah. Now, before you were focused on what, and what are you focused on when you go into this state? In other words, still looking ahead, but everything around sort of comes in. Yeah, everything around, and what is everything around?

Well, movement all around, in other words. Right, you're getting there. Who has an idea about what you're focusing on when you're actually in this state? In terms of, I don't know if you've thought of this before, but when you're focusing on the central

# Unconscious Mind, Quantumphysics, What You Believe Is Real Determines Your Result

Okay, so the question is, the question is, when you think about it, what is it that allows us to connect with neurotransmitters? What is it that allows us to get in there? So let me give you some thoughts here for just a minute. And then you think about that. So every single cell in the human body is bathed in neurotransmitter.

This was actually discovered by molecular biologists. And for those of you who would like to read the source on that, Candice Pert, who is a very well-known molecular biologist, was written up in the book Healing in the Mind, which I think is one of the major landmark books about the connection between the mind and the body, written by Bill Moyers. Actually, Bill Moyers did a PBS special on it a few years back, and even that was missed in terms of its importance. All right, so here's the question. The question is, if every single cell has bathed the neurotransmitter, then of co

So where are we? Let's go back and review for a second. What you focus on determines the results. What you believe is real is real. And if you can change your reality, you'll actually change, if you can change your reality, you'll actually change the results that happen in your life.

If you change your beliefs about reality, you'll actually make the changes. If you change your thinking, you can actually change just about everything that goes on in your universe. So first of all, it's a matter of focus. First of all, it's a matter of focus. Milton Erickson was very, very big on focus.

He was very, very big on focus. He said, you can tune your awareness and you can move it in different ways and in different directions. And there was a client that came in with tinnitus. You know, tinnitus is like ringing in the ears, right? And the client came in with tinnitus and he said, just tune your awareness.

Just allow your awareness to be... He said,

# Body, Presupp, Metaphors, Remedial Vs Generative Change, Pattern Intterupt

What other presuppositions do you like? Any others? Yeah? Mind and body affect each other. We talked about that earlier, didn't we?

About neurotransmitter being present in every, or bathing every single cell of the human body. Now we have the proof, although missed earlier on by science, what's happening is we're coming full circle. And what I notice is that there's more and more, regularly I notice more and more people who are coming to NLP from the traditional medical field and from the traditional therapeutic field who are looking for the presuppositions that we have in NLP as assisting them and guiding them in what they're doing. So mind and body affect each other. I had a client call me, this is a very funny story.

She called me from Kauai and she goes, I have asthma, can you help me? I said, sure, sure, let me just ask you a couple questions before we make an appointment. Do you smoke? And she said, n

# Quatum Nature Of The Nervous System, Quantum Linguistics, Presuppositions

So let's now talk about quantum linguistics, and we're returning to page one in section number two. So think about this for just a minute as we're about to embark on our language section. By the way, language forms the basis for all of our NLP techniques because it's how we communicate. We cover language first because it's how we're going to communicate with each other. And even though it's only 7%, remember from your practitioner training, even as though it's 7%, there are ways that we can communicate with other people that will fit into the quantum nature of who we are.

And if we use our language in a way which is quantum, what will happen is we'll actually make changes with the client in a way that affects the neurology, in a way that actually changes the neurology and makes a difference at the neurological level. And the way we do this is by affecting the boundaries of the neurological pattern. We do this

# Quantum Linguistics, Cartesian Logic, Predicate Calculus, Inductive-Deductive, Chunking

Now we're ready to talk about the heart of quantum linguistics. What I'm about to share with you is the heart of quantum linguistics. I'm indebted to a guy that used to work with me named Don Anderson for some of this. And Don was a calculus nut. Let's look at page 26.

So here's what comprises the heart of quantum linguistics. First is Cartesian logic, and Cartesian logic, Cartesian coordinates, Cartesian logic are four simple patterns that reshape thinking in a multidimensional way. We're looking at slide 20. Cartesian logic are four simple patterns, very, very simple patterns that reshape your thinking in a multidimensional way. Let's talk about why thinking needs to be reshaped in a multidimensional way.

One of the interesting things about a quantum mechanical device is that it's multidimensional, not single-dimensional. So have you ever had a problem and somebody walked up to you and says, 

--- FILE: NLP  04b-inductive-deductive, presupp, quantum linguistics.txt ---
# Deductive, Presupp, Quantum Linguistics

So here's the plan. We're about to do an exercise. Okay, directionalized language also relies on, perhaps a little bit on your understanding of the hierarchy of ideas. I'm going to assume you've already got this for purposes of this particular exercise, but there are some things you can ask yourself to chunk up if you want to assist yourself in the process of moving toward greater abstraction. You probably had this in your practitioner training.

You can ask yourself to chunk up or to move more toward the abstract. You can ask yourself, what is this an example of or for what purpose or what is your intention? In chunking down, you can ask yourself, what or whom specifically or what are examples of this? Or actually, any metamodel question will also chunk you down. We're going to come back to this when we move into negotiation.

We're going to have some negotiation thinking after a bit. But let's go back first of all and look at page two, nine,

--- FILE: NLP  05a-parts, constructing reality, time scramble, decision destroyer.txt ---
# Parts, Constructing Reality, Time Scramble, Decision Destroyer

Next presupposition. Slide number 32. Did you ever think you have to know everything in order to proceed? How many people used to have that problem? Anyone?

I forget, right, exactly. Walter Heisenberg summed it up the best. This is called the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It's part of quantum physics. Heisenberg said, we will never, ever know all there is to know.

We will never, ever know all there is to know. Heisenberg said this. It's not possible to know everything there is to know. Therefore, we will always have to proceed with uncertain, unclear, and ambiguous information and incomplete information. That's the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

Does that sound like anything? It sounds like confusion, actually. So, I don't know, I think roughly two-thirds of the room was in confusion last night. And how did you do? Very well.

Did you move to a new level of order? Exactly. Exactly. And actually, inductive langu

Okay, how did that last exercise go? Welcome back. Any questions about this process? I wonder if that worked for her. For those of you listening to the tapes, we have a picture of one of our delighted clients on this.

I think. You notice the smoke coming out of her ears. Any questions about the process? Good. Good.

Like I said, the decision destroyer is something you can do like a quick fix. It works with a number of different modalities of either time, space, matter, or energy. Simultaneously, it is something that we don't have to necessarily take a detailed personal history for. And there may be times when you want to take a detailed personal history, but there may be times when you don't want to, and you don't want to go through all of timeline therapy, in which case this is a very quick sort of process. Yeah?

The question was, it seemed like there's something underneath that that may come up as well. Yes

# Logical Levels, Hierarchy Of Ideas, Miltonmodel, Hierarchy Of Ideas Negatiation Model

All right, welcome back. Now it's time to talk about chunking. So let's look at page 213. We've implied chunking. We've talked a little bit about it.

We said definitely go from abstract to specific or from specific to abstract. But let's talk for a moment about the hierarchy of ideas. And we're on page 213. What the hierarchy of ideas essentially says is that as you think about something, you can think either abstractly or specifically. And if we, for example, were to start in cars, which is in the center of your model here on the right side on page 213, if we were to start thinking about cars and we were to go one level more abstract, which is in the opposite direction of the arrow, for example, we were to go to transportation, the way we would get there is we'd ask ourselves, what are cars an example of?

And we might get the word transportation, or we might say, for cars, for what purpose? And

# Metamodeliii, Not Knowing, De-Identification, Changing Reality Strategy

Okay, how did that, metamodel three, how did that go? Good. Any questions about that? Yes. When you're finished any of these exercises, the client, when you ask them where the problem is, they have forgotten.

The problem's gone, but they can remember what the problem, what the issue was. Did your clients remember what the issue was? Some did, some didn't. Right. So that's normal.

Typically, that's the way it will be. Thank you. Thanks for asking. In fact, for some clients, these will be a complete intervention in and of themselves. For some clients, they will not be.

For some clients, you'll have to take a detailed personal history. For some clients, you won't have to. It depends on the depth of the problem. It depends on everything considered about the client. Well, the next question was, we were wondering if the person that could remember the issue, if it was actually cleared, like if that was...

Right, so

# Parts, Sleight Of Mouth Patters

There are some questions. We had an interesting thing there working with Matthew. We got both of his parts up to the unlimitedness, and then we find out he's got a boss part that runs those. And then we came to find out that there was a boss part several echelons up above that boss part. That's what we were talking about, hierarchy of parts.

I guess he must have a parts union. That would be local 301. Finally, he asked for the hierarchy of parts, so we did that, and he turned a lovely shade of purple. Yeah, it was great. Is that beyond more blood flow then?

Yeah, it had pretty decent integration, it looked like. Good for you, Murray. That's great. It was a great lesson because we both had sort of sneaky parts. Sneaky parts?

Ted, you've mentioned several times that in our small branch of NLP, the idea is for the greatest amount of integration, and other branches seem to want to have more parts. Not necessarily. But what would be the purpose? Maybe n

# Sleight Of Mouth, Prime Concerns

All right, welcome back. So how did you guys do on your slight of mouth patterns that you worked out? So I want to hear the best. One of the issues was I don't have enough time, or I don't have time to talk to you, or I don't have time to talk about it. That's a typical business sales put-off, isn't it?

That's right. And under number 13, outcome, one thing we came up with was the issue here is not whether you and I talk, but whether or not your company can benefit from what we have to offer. That's great. That's good. That's good.

I like that. I like that. Excellent. Excellent. Our objection was doing this therapy with you doesn't mean it will work for me, and to change it to a model or change the model of the world.

A lot of clients hold that belief, and it works despite themselves. I like that. I like that, and I like the ambiguity. I like the ambiguity of despite themselves. It could be phonologically ambiguous, which is to spite yourself, whic

--- FILE: NLP  09b-prime concerns, the null set.txt ---
# Prime Concerns, The Null Set

So, page 249 is the elicitation. And here's what we do. We're also on slide number 80. You want to ask the first two questions almost in a row. The answer to the first question is not significant from the point of view of prime concerns.

That is to say, the reason for the first question is to light up the neural networks. But in terms of it being a prime concern, usually if a person's best at something, that's not going to be what needs assistance, or they don't need help in that area. They're going to need help in the area that they're worst at. So the first question, when you say to the client, what you essentially will say to the client is, what are you best at, starting things, changing things, or stopping things? Ask this question to yourself for just a moment.

What are you best at, starting things, changing things, or stopping things? Think about it for just a minute. What are you best at, starting things, changing things, or stopping things? Thi

# Strategies, Logical Levels Of Therapy

All right, what's next? Logical levels of therapy, page 235, and we're going to look at slide number 89 at the same time. Logical levels of therapy is a chunking process, which very effectively, it's a little less quantum linguistics and a little more strategy elicitation. So logical levels of therapy, to me, provides the bridge between the content of linguistics or the linguistics and the elicitation of strategies. So we're moving into something where we're actually going to begin to look at how do you work with a strategy and how do you do something in a way that will make a difference in someone's strategy without being particularly obtrusive about it?

You know, without actually getting in the way of it. And if you look at slide number 93, we use strategies for everything. And one of my theories is that all human behavior is a result of an order and sequence of internal and external representations. So there could be strategies for decisions

So when you get frustrated, you eat. Is that the program? Your mother does it too. Oh, great. Now she's helping.

I don't get that aggravated. You don't get that aggravated, yeah, anymore. Okay, let's see now. What's this problem now? Tell me again so I can be...

When I get really upset with something, I have this urge to just run to the fridge and eat because when I eat a lot, I can't do anything about thinking. I just have to digest my food. Hmm. I see. Okay, okay, okay.

So what would you like to do instead? I'd like to get rid of that feeling inside of me that sort of churns, that encourages me to run to the fridge. Or because, I mean, life happens and things happen to upset us. What if we just simply change the response of what happens when you go to the fridge? And I'm looking at the ecology of this thing.

It seems to me that if it's time to get upset, it's time to get upset. And I don't think I'd want to personally take that away from you, per se.

# Eyetracking, Synesthesias

Okay, so for strategy elicitation, here's the news. You probably should have also, in addition to memorizing page 813, you probably should have also memorized the eye patterns. Yeah. Shouldn't we have? Yeah.

Probably should have memorized the eye patterns. So let's talk about the NLP eye patterns. The NLP eye patterns have been a subject of much interesting debate outside of NLP. The psychologists of the United States Army decided that eye patterns, the NLP eye patterns didn't actually work and they published, I would say, a book that was about an inch thick refuting the issue. And that was because, if you look at me for just a second, that was because when they asked the generals in the Pentagon what color their house was, the generals in the Pentagon went like this, down to Auditory Digital to repeat the question, then they went up to visual to find out what color their house was, and so the Department of the Army decided that iPads were not useful becau

# Logical Levels Of Therapy, Strategy Elicitation

Hey, welcome back. How was that exercise? Did you guys do good? Yeah, logical levels of therapy is a lot of fun, isn't it? What kind of questions or comments do you have?

Any questions? Or comments? Yes. Okay. When you get to the end and you've blown it all out and they still go, you know, you can still reaccess it, what's the next thing you do?

It depends. You may not have run the submodalities out to the limit enough times. So you might go back and do it again. Or if, I mean, you can just go right into timeline therapy. Logical levels of therapy doesn't always work, but my guess is it will sufficiently loosen up the model so that the client will not have a firm hold on it as much.

So you could go on and do timeline therapy. Logical levels of therapy is really good, in my opinion, for loosening up the model, loosening up the client's model in order, loosening up the problem, the hold on the problem so that it disappears. And it's r

# Strategy Elicitation

Okay, strategies are next. And in terms of how do you elicit a strategy, it's pretty simple. You just kind of ask. And personally, I prefer a number of different ways to ask the questions. I think if I were, like, for example, if I were selling real estate, I think one of the first things I'd ask my clients is, I'd say to my clients, you know, one of the things I like to do is ask my clients some questions, which may sound really strange when you first ask them, but what it will do is it will allow me to discover how you would decide to buy a house and how you'd be motivated to buy a house and then how you'd be reassured that the house was a good purchase for you.

So I hope you don't mind if I ask, and then just go ahead and ask your questions. I think I really would do that if I were, if I were selling real estate or insurance or cars. And what I would do is I'd couch, and when, when we did this consulting, we used to ask our clients right up front, you know?

# Chaining Anchors

Okay, with all those caveats, let's find out from you guys. Assuming we were doing a chain of procrastination to motivation, what would be a really good second state? Murray? Boredom. And what did Murray do, what did Murray do when he, when he mentioned the word boredom?

He actually used an adjective modifier. And what Murray did was he used an adjective modifier to, obviously, Murray, you've taken our accelerated practitioner training and you've done well. Murray used an adjective modifier to modify the state of boredom to the point where he called it excruciating boredom. So anytime you take a state like this with a client, you're talking to a client, anytime you're going to ask the client, well, what would be a good second state, then you want to amplify that state so that it really is heavy duty. And so don't just say boredom, but say excruciating boredom.

I like that. Boredom is a threshold for you. A little bit wouldn't move you. I like it. Having to watch y

# Strategy Design

You guys have done the exercise. Everyone here just about has done a chain installation. So we're going to move on to page 8.5 because we want to talk about installing or changing strategies. And as I mentioned before in the practitioner tape set as well as in the accelerated practitioner training, there's not a lot of difference between a strategy installation and a chain design and installation. There are just a few more considerations that we're going to have, and we're working also with different representational systems.

So we're working with different rep systems to see how that works. So let's look at page 8.5 and look at what some of the structural well-forminous conditions for strategies are. Usually there's a well-defined representation of the outcome. We're on page 8.5 under structural well-forminous conditions. That all, there are at least three of the major, that would be visual, auditory, and kinesthetic, are used.

That there's at least three points i

# Submods, Drivers, Contrastive Analyses

We're going to move on to not just submodalities, but the advanced patterns of NLP. And to me, these are kind of fun. There are some patterns that we need to learn. There are some patterns which are very, actually quite, I would say, intense and may be useful under certain circumstances, and there may be some patterns which you may ultimately end up using. So let's talk a little bit about some of the issues in submodalities and what actually makes submodalities work.

For some of you, this will be a review. And for some of you, this may be the first time that you've actually heard this. And we're going to be talking and looking at Section 4, page 1. So there are some issues that really, really make a difference with regards to submodalities. And we're looking at slide number 101.

There are some issues which will make your submodality interventions work, and these are actually quite important submodality distinctions, and ones I think which wil

# Submods, Designer Swish Patterns, Neurological Drivers, Entering The Void

So let's talk about designer swish patterns. Let's talk about designer swish patterns, and we're actually looking at slide number 104. 104 is the standard swish pattern. It's the swish pattern, put the little box in the lower left-hand corner. Have it explode big and bright until it covers up the other one. Blah, blah, blah.

You all do that, right? You've done that. Okay. Now, this one is real effective if the drivers are what? But not distance.

Unless you have it zoom out to the horizon. And certainly the location's the same for the old picture and the new picture. So there are some clients for whom this switch pattern will not work, and the switch pattern on slide number 105 will work. And what are those drivers here? So in this case, we're going to assume that there's a driver of distance because the other one didn't have distance, did it?

The distance was the same in every case. A driver of size because

# Making Submods Work, Compulsion Blowout, Learning State, Allergy Model, Illness

The compulsion blowout I've used three times in my NLP career. I want you to know that it's worked every time, and it's a very, very intense for the client and for the master practitioner technique. It is really intense. But for some compulsions like anorexia and bulimia, it's a really good intervention. By the way, anorexia is life-threatening.

Here's a disclaimer. Anorexia is life-threatening, and you may want, if you're going to work with anorexia, you may want to have a doctor refer the client to you because it is a life-threatening disease. Okay, what is anorexia? Anorexia is a what? It's actually a revulsion.

Anorexia is a revulsion. It's a revulsion about food. And bulimia is what? A compulsion plus a revulsion. So bulimia's got two parts.

It's a compulsion and a revulsion. And so if you're going to do a compulsion blowout for bulimia, you've got to do both of them. Okay, so bulimia is a compul

That's the theory. Now the technique. Page 418. This is a Hiolani meditation. It comes from Huna.

This is the one we teach at Level 1 of Huna. We have a number of different meditation techniques, but this is kind of a fun one. And this is meditation on a light. So the first thing to do is to find a comfortable place to sit in it, like in a chair or on the ground, and darken the room or cover your eyes so that no external light gets in. This is really important the first time you do it that you're in a place which is really dark.

We're going to meditate a little bit so you have an experience of doing it here. And if you're going to continue with this particular technique of meditation, you may want to make sure that the first however many times you do it, the first few times anyway, that you are totally in a room where it's totally dark.

All right. Welcome back. That was interesting, huh? Let's see again how many people had a moment of transcendence there. Or some moment.

That's great. Just about everyone did. That's really fabulous. That's a really nice technique of meditation. We did 15 minutes.

That was what we just did. I kind of like it because it's different. And it's also a Huna. It's one of our Huna meditations. There are a number of different Huna techniques, but that's one of the Huna meditations.

So I bring that up because from an NLP point of view, I think it's important to be able to access that kind of neurology. I think the more neurological choices we have, the better. Anybody have any comments or questions about what we just did? You guys are too zoned, I think. We could use a reframe for that, though, like there's no such thing.

Okay, welcome back. What questions do you have? Since we're doing a series of Hakalau anchors and exercises, if once we pick an initial point, we can just stack each exercise on the same point? Well, actually, you're stacking a Hakalau anchor, not the exercise per se, but the anchor. You certainly can stack it.

But my guess is that by now, you probably have got enough stack there that you would go into peripheral vision anyway, just pretty automatically. Right. And you can go into peripheral vision anyway automatically if you want to. Right. It's just that, you know, I'd rather have it one space than having one on my toe and my knee and my arm.

Well, okay. Yes, certainly. Then put it wherever you'd like. And have it be there, wherever it is. Thank you.

# Modeling, Boardbreaking

What we're going to do is this will be our modeling project. Most NLP master practitioner trainings actually do a modeling project where they model some behavior. And in many trainings, I guess, in many trainings they just pick something to model, but we thought we'd pick something significant, which is how one breaks through certain limitations. By the way, this segment is not required for you to be certified as a master practitioner of NLP. You don't need to break your board in order to be certified.

That's not part of it. But what this will allow you to do is it will allow you to discover, among other things, your congruency and your ability to follow through and your ability to actually do modeling. For me, I kind of like the process because it tells me how I'm doing in terms of allowing the energy to flow through me and around me and how I I'm allowing the energy to be, and also how I'm relating to that thing there, which looks like about 12 inches squa

Okay. I just perceived that at first you seemed kind of casual compared to Tad's physiology. Yours was less intense. But when you actually broke the board, you got mad. And that's what I saw.

I'm not sure that was true. But when the intensity was there, I mean, you were unstoppable. Is that what happened? That's what it feels like. Same question as to Tad.

When you decided to break it, how did you know when it was time to break it? And further on from that, when you didn't break it, what was your reassurance strategy to know when the second time to break it, and what was the difference? I've done one-inch breaks before, so I know that I can do them. When

Okay, next one is internal state, and the question is whether a person is thinking or feeling. The thinker, the person who is a thinker, is going to evaluate the external world based on what they think about it. And the feeler, and by the way, in the Myers-Briggs feeling isn't just related to internal kinesthetics. What they also mean is the evaluative feelings, which are essentially values. So the feeler in Myers-Briggs deals more with values, and the thinker in Myers-Briggs deals more with logic and reasonableness and rationalness.

For example, do you more often let your heart rule your head or your head rule your heart is one of the questions that they ask in order to determine whether a person is a thinker or a feeler. Another one that they ask is, is it a higher compliment to be called a person of real feeling or a consistently reasonable person? So the thinker is going to be more logical, reasonable, and rational. The feeler is going to be someone who's more into values

To change someone, I've never, to be honest with you, I've never had an extrovert come to me and ask me to be more introverted. So, I've never had an extrovert come to me and say, I'm too extroverted, can you help me be more introverted? I have had introverts come to me and say, can you help me be more extroverted? Typically, the process that I'll use there is timeline therapy, and what we'll do is get rid of any limiting decisions that there are with regards to meeting or being with other people or hanging out with them or feeling comfortable or safe. Those are typically the intervention for assisting an introvert to be an extrovert.

Okay, the next is timeline therapy and probably there is a limiting decision in the past or there could be some, an event which would relate to feeling safe about being with people, or being okay to be out there, you know, etc. Okay, internal process. I've had people come and ask me for both, to change both of those, and that's hier

Next one is the reason filter. And the reason filter will give us information about the reason why a person will do something. It's the reason why somebody will do something. The question is why are you choosing to do what you're doing? And then you listen for the answer.

We're on page 3-4, the reason filter. Why are you choosing to do what you're doing and the person will give you the answer? The answer could indicate possibility or necessity or both. Someone who is working from necessity will essentially give you a story about why they're choosing to do what they're doing, which is that there's no choice. They didn't choose it.

It was chosen for them. I remember one notable mid-level manager who was working at this engineering firm who were consulting and were doing we were doing business consulting. And I said, why are you, this guy was like the most necessity person I've ever heard. And by the way, most of the people, there have been

# Changing Individual Metaprograms

Let's look at how to change metaprograms. Of course, it's in the book, but I want to run down some considerations that occurred since then. First of all, generally, let's just say generally. Generally, any metaprogram can be changed with hypnosis. Just use hypnosis, figure out a metaphor, use the metaphor, assist the person in changing.

So, for example, page 3-4, frame of reference, how do you know when you're doing a good job? Client has an internal frame of reference, wanted to change it to internal with an external check. What I said was, can you walk down a flight of stairs with 70 steps? Now you're at the bottom. Oh, look over there to the right.

There's the frame of reference switch. Flip it from, flip the switch so it goes down to the next position, which is internal to external check. Walk back up to 70 steps. That's one way. Another way to change them is consider them as strategies and so utilize the strategy.

Okay, so what we'd like you to do is to share with us your results on this and give us any feedback, if you would. Please email us at mind at aloha.com. Any questions or comments that you might have about these three metaprograms, we're going to continue to develop them, so by the time you hear those tapes, they may be far more developed than what we've done, and we'll be teaching it in our Master Practitioner class each year in June, July, wherever that is. It may not be at this hotel, but since we haven't said what hotel, you won't know. Or it may be at the other hotel.

And every November, every October, November, so keep in touch. And those of you guys who got this, give me some feedback on it if you think different questions would work better, but test them.

# Model Of Therapy, Working With Couples, Values

Okay, other questions about interventions or order and sequence of therapy? We're looking at page 5-1, by the way. Ted, I was just a bit unclear on how you said to proceed with couples therapy. Did you say that you proceeded together or separately? Let's go over it.

That particular family therapy model is on page 4-11. This is covered in the Timeline Therapy Practitioner tape set, and so I'm just going to go over a brief review. Typically what I'll do with two people is I'll do two hours together, two hours each separately, and two hours together. Two hours together, two hours each separately, and two hours together. Okay?

Two hours together, two hours each separately, and two hours together, which makes a total of eight hours. It says here, this model takes approximately eight to ten hours for a couple, add two hours for each additional person. And from an LP point of view, there are mainly two reasons why relationships end, either n

# Transitions In, Strategy To Select, 6 Areas For Elicitation Of

So let's just jump right down to the transition of values on page 325. Yes, question, Linda. Question is, does this apply to the hierarchy of values that a person goes through in their lifetime as well? What the theory essentially says is that people grow and evolve and their values change and generally people's values tend to move in this direction from values level 2 to 3 to 4 to 5 to 6 to 7, 8 and so forth. One of the things that was important to me and I don't want to get too deeply into the content of it because I'm mostly interested in change.

Remember we said when we said metaprograms, this is NLP, what we're interested in is how do you elicit them, but also how do you change them. We're also interested in how do you change values. It seems to me, however, that there's going to be certain issues that a person is dealing with at a certain values level. I don't know if you remember your own life, but probably you'v

# Evaluating The Hierarchy, Values Utilization

Welcome back. What questions do you have? Yes, Murray. We can change these, right? Are you worried?

No, they're cast in stone, Murray. They're going to stay with you for the next 16 lifetimes. Just kidding, just kidding. We can change them, yes, for sure. We can change our values, but one thing is just because your values are the way they are, one of my is, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, okay?

The next thing, we have to find something else out about the values. So, you guys, what we did was we did, first thing we did was, there's just a general elicitation, what's important to you. Second thing we did was for motivation strategy. Third thing we got was the stay-go loop, right? Which was the threshold value.

So all these present, what would have to happen, such as it would cause you to stay, all these being present, plus this one, what would happen, it would cause you to leave. And you go back and forth, and you loop on that until you

# Elicitation Of Values, Hierarchy Of Values

Okay, so what I'd like to do is to simply demonstrate the elicitation of values and do it contextually. And we'll go through actually the three different ways of eliciting. This is the first way of doing an elicitation. And for this, I'll need a volunteer. First of all, let me see about context.

So how many people are here to use NLP in business? Okay, and how many people intend to use NLP in a therapeutic application? And that's, but that's also your career, right? And then how many people for education? Okay, all right.

So what I need is I need someone who would be interested in looking at your values and going through that in a number of different ways. And I think what we'll do is we'll look at career values. I think that probably would be a good thing to do. One of the criteria, this is all about, by the way, demo selection. One of the things you have to do when you're demonstrating something is to demonstrate what you're demonstrati

# Values Exercise, Changing Values In Hierarchy

Okay, so what I'd like to do is the following. If you would, I'd like you to get together with the same people that you were just with and go ahead and do what we just did with some in terms of going through the values hierarchy you've got. You've got a values hierarchy now. And go through and identify, you've got them in order already, go through and identify any possible conflicts or how the hierarchy is based on the sheet of paper that you've got in front of you with all those things to do, which is essentially we're working from page 324. Yes?

Would you suggest that the list of persons ends? I don't think, here's the thing, I don't think you, if you have a lot of values, and here's my point of view. I guess I should say this. My point of view is that the first four or five values for a client are what's going to be acted upon. And once you get below four or five, they are less important.

Once you get down below the fourth or fifth

# Interventions In Values,Motivation Changes After An Intervention

Next question, Brian. All right. During that, you had just mentioned that you had asked in the question what's important to you about living. And I was wondering when would you ask that question in illicit values about what I perceive to be a bigger chunk of living rather than career, relationships, spirituality, family, health and fitness? I began to elicit values in the context in which they were going to appear when I realized personally that the values elicitations that we were doing or that we had done were too broad-based to be useful contextually.

So look at slide number 150. One of the major things about NLP that we do is we contextualize the change. So there are a lot of values tests and a lot of values, especially the Rokic values test, for example, if you're familiar with that or if you've studied psychology, that just simply ask broad-based values in life. The problem with that is, from an NLP point of vie

Before we actually do an exercise, and we are going to do an exercise, I want to demonstrate the other interventions that are necessary in this regard to do when you do it, and then I want to have you all get together and do that as an exercise. But I do want to demonstrate some other things along the way. Is that all right? Yeah? Okay.

Matthew. How are you today? Since you shared with us your... Since you shared... Did you bring your values with you?

He says, yeah, I brought them with me. You carry them with you often? That's good. It's like the boards you guys carried with you the first week, right? No.

No. No, it is like the boards because with the boards you knew you were going to have a breakthrough. Yeah. And you did have a breakthrough, didn't you? Yeah.

Okay. Can I look at your values? You can. Let's see what they say here. Whoa, I hear some nods here.

I actually hear them. I'm reading this and I hear them. Compatibility with belief is a way

# Intervention, Values Transitions

Well, this is fabulous because I got to demonstrate parts integration and also using the peripheral vision as part of an intervention. So what I'd like you to do next is to go through and do what we did. So you're going to take the values hierarchy with the same group of people, same groups, and what I'd like you to do is go back and literally go through your values hierarchy and look at the values that are present. Notice the away froms and have the client go into Hakalao, into peripheral vision, and notice if the away-froms disappear simply with that intervention, using that neurological driver. The truth is that, in my experience, this may not clear up all the away-froms, but clearing up all the away-froms in a person's given hierarchy requires this.

And you may want to write this down. And the best place to write this is, to me, and I don't want to tell you where to put your notes, but somewhere near page 324, because that's the page you're goin

All right, so as we begin to wrap up this master practitioner training, I want to just go back and review a little, and I want to talk about NLP and healing in the big picture. We've certainly got a lot of detailed information about NLP and healing in the master practitioner timeline therapy tape set and in the master hypnosis tape set, which is called Deep Transphenomena. I hope that we have answered and I hope also called attention to you for you to begin to look at and to also pay attention a little bit differently to some of the questions that you have or perhaps you didn't have. Like, for example, the questions why, what, how, and what if. And I also hope that we've actually created some new ones for you to look at.

As we move into NLP and healing, and by the way, we just looked at slide number 112, gone back and reviewed slide number 112. And as we begin to look at NLP and healing, we're going to start with the

Okay, so there's a relationship between the thoughts you think and the possible diseases you may produce. There's a relationship between your temperament and the kind of prevalent thinking that occurs in your body and the kinds of diseases you may produce. Why is that? Wall chart number two, you remember our diagram on the very first day of the neuron and the neurotransmitter, and how we said that every single cell in the body is affected by neurotransmitter, because every thought that you think is transmitted to your body. So essentially, the prevalent thoughts that you think will create your body, and will affect your health health and essentially will create your body.

And we create our body based on what? We create our body based on observation and the filters. And essentially the way we do that is from the void. In fact, if you look at slide number 107, at the level of the void, there's no time. Although we create our body from that, it manifests on the surface bas

# Parts Integration

All right, welcome back. How did that exercise go? Yeah? Did you notice that it was relatively easy to get to the same level of agreement? Yeah?

You noticed that? Did you notice that it was relatively easy to separate intention from behavior with a conditional close? Yes? But did you notice that it took a little more, did you notice it took actually quite a bit more skill to chunk down as quickly as you can, all the while maintaining agreement? Let me give you just one final piece to that, and then we'll move on.

The one final piece to that is, quite honestly, if you get to a point where you chunk down and the two people say no, they don't want to do it, then what you do is you go back to number two, to the conditional close again, and you go back to their highest level intention. So if at number three you don't actually, if you're not actually totally successful at getting them to do that while maintaining agreement, then simply go back up to the specific word y

The question is, what's the first thing that you want to do? Probably the first thing you want to do if you really want to integrate the conscious mind and the unconscious mind is to present some information. Okay, let's look at page 414. There's about 30 things I do when I'm doing a training. I'll often sort of open loops and sort of not close them, as you noticed.

Builds an air of expectancy. Let's get on with it. That sort of thing. We can also structure the state of the students moment to moment using hypnotic language patterns and anchoring these states. One of the things I wonder if you've noticed is that you're pretty much anchored to the sound of my voice.

And from time to time that I can change the tone and the tempo and the pitch of my voice. And as I do, that you can probably experience certain shifts in your consciousness to where it gets easier and easier just to sort of settle down and pay attention to certain internal states and processe

Let's move on to modeling. And our modeling page is, it's in section four, and it's page five. We're also going to put up slide 113, just for fun. One time, I think it was several years ago now, I had a fellow come to me and he said, I wanted to learn modeling. He said, can I, what do you suggest that I do?

And I said to him, well, because at that point I had taught some modeling trainings with, shall we say, one of the founders of NLP. But I said, you know, there's this modeling course. Why don't you go take it? And so he did. And he came back and he said, I really want to learn modeling.

Can you help me do that? And I said, oh, yeah, just come to our master practitioner class. We'll spend about an hour and a half on it. And you'll understand it totally, and then you'll be able to do them. Because he came back from his modeling training, which was two weeks, and he couldn't really understand quite how to do it.

I'm not suggesting that we can shorten the time that it tak

And Sun had some revelations in the middle of the night, which probably are as uncomfortable as what Matthew experienced, so that's good. To me, it's like, to me, when a client calls me up and says, oh my God, I just realized something terrible, I go, all right.

So son, what what did you realize last night in the middle of thinking about or maybe not thinking about all of this? Some was in the night.
