## Prompt
```text
You are an expert World Builder and Editor.

# Goal
Refine and expand the world configuration based on the current state and any user instructions.

# Current World State
Title: FixedWorld

## Setting
Helena operates internationally, splitting her time between her hometown of Shanghai and a small, picturesque town in Germany. Her goal is to build a life that seamlessly bridges these two cultures while pursuing a new career in transformational coaching, leaving behind the rigid structure of the corporate world.

## Theme
The Silent Language of Structure. The storyline focuses on the disconnect between Helena's intellectual expertise and the messy reality of human emotion. As she takes on her first client, the narrative explores how the AI WATCH teaches her to read the 'source code' of human experience—posture, breathing, and linguistic patterns—without ever explicitly naming them as NLP. It is a journey from trying to force change through logic to facilitating change through observation and rapport.

## The Glitch (Inciting Incident)
The Dough Wall. Helena's first official session with Klaus Eichel is a disaster. She attempts to apply a high-level corporate SWOT analysis to his struggling family bakery, but Klaus shuts down, crossing his arms and refusing to engage. Feeling her authority slipping and panic rising, Helena's WATCH vibrates—not with a text, but with a slow, rhythmic pulse against her wrist. It displays a simple, abstract visual matching Klaus's slow breathing rate. This intervention forces Helena to stop talking, drop her 'professional' tempo, and unconsciously learn the skill of 'pacing' to re-establish connection, turning a near-failure into a breakthrough.

## Characters
- Helena (Protagonist): A 40-ish Asian woman, intelligent and elegant, with an MBA and a history of high-level corporate roles in China and Germany. She recently left a strategic marketing position to start her own coaching business, seeking autonomy and deeper meaning.
  Tags: Coach, Ex-Corporate, MBA, Protagonist
- The WATCH (Mentor): A prototype AI-driven wearable gifted by her husband. It integrates into her workflow, offering subtle, cryptic, Yoda-like guidance rather than direct instructions. It helps Helena decode human behavior and navigate her new career by visualizing invisible patterns. Some user got the feeling the watch can read your mind. It knows everything about you. First time you use it, it connects on a neural way with you and links to all your other systems. A very new item and we do not really understand how it works yet. 
  Tags: AI, Device, Guide, Yoda-like
- AGG (Ai Ge Ge) (Pet / Confidant): Helena's cat. Helena solidifies her learning by 'teaching' concepts to AGG at the end of the day, using the pet as a non-judgmental audience for her reflections on the human mind.
  Tags: Cat, Soundboard, Love Princess
- Lars Weber (Antagonist): Helena's former superior. He represents the safety and prestige of the corporate world she left. He frequently tempts her with lucrative consulting offers, serving as the voice of the 'Fixed World' and doubt.
  Tags: Corporate Executive, Skeptic, Tempter
- Sophie 'Trend' Chen (Foil): A viral 'Life Guru' in Shanghai who relies on trends and hollow quotes. She contrasts with Helena's desire for deep, structural change, challenging Helena to prove that substance matters more than style.
  Tags: Influencer, Superficial, Shanghai
- Klaus Eichel (First Client / Catalyst): Owner of a 200-year-old bakery. Skeptical of coaching and resistant to change, yet desperate to save his legacy. He tests Helena's ability to translate abstract concepts into practical reality.
  Tags: Traditionalist, Stubborn, German Local
- Tobias 'Tobi' Richter (Supporter): Helena's husband and a systems engineer. He created the WATCH to optimize her workflow. Literal-minded and supportive, he grounds Helena in physical reality when she gets too lost in the abstract nuances of coaching.
  Tags: Husband, Engineer, Grounding


# Instructions
1. **Analyze** the current state above. Look for any text starting with "AI:" or "Instruction:" - these are direct commands from the user to change something (e.g., "AI: make the tone darker").
2. **Refine** the content.
   - If an "AI:" instruction exists, apply it and **remove** the instruction text.
   - If fields are empty, generate high-quality, creative content fitting the title/genre.
   - Ensure consistency between Setting, Theme, Glitch, and Characters.
3. **Expand** characters.
   - You can modify existing characters if instructed.
   - You can add new characters if the world feels empty (aim for ~5 key characters total).
   - Ensure characters have conflicting goals and clear roles.

# Output Format
Return strictly a single valid JSON object with this structure:
{
  "setting": "...",
  "theme": "...",
  "glitch_concept": "...",
  "characters": [
    { "name": "...", "role": "...", "tags": ["..."], "description": "..." }
  ]
}

DO NOT include markdown formatting (```json). Return ONLY the JSON.
