# Title
FixedWorld

# Characters
- **Helena** (Protagonist): A 40-ish Asian woman, intelligent and elegant, with an MBA and a history of high-level corporate roles in China and Germany. She recently left a strategic marketing position to start her own coaching business, seeking autonomy and deeper meaning.
- **The WATCH** (Mentor): A prototype AI-driven wearable gifted by her husband, Tobias. While ostensibly designed for workflow optimization, it operates with an unnerving intuition. Upon its first initialization, it established a near-neural connection, linking with Helena's bio-rhythms and digital footprint instantly. It offers subtle, cryptic, Yoda-like guidance, visualizing invisible behavioral patterns. It is a technological black box; even its creator isn't sure how it knows what it knows.
- **AGG (Ai Ge Ge)** (Confidant): Helena's cat. Helena solidifies her learning by 'teaching' concepts to AGG at the end of the day, using the pet as a non-judgmental audience for her reflections on the human mind.
- **Lars Weber** (Antagonist): Helena's former superior. He represents the safety and prestige of the corporate world she left. He frequently tempts her with lucrative consulting offers, serving as the voice of the 'Fixed World' and doubt.
- **Sophie 'Trend' Chen** (Foil): A viral 'Life Guru' in Shanghai who relies on trends and hollow quotes. She contrasts with Helena's desire for deep, structural change, challenging Helena to prove that substance matters more than style.
- **Klaus Eichel** (Catalyst): Owner of a 200-year-old bakery. Skeptical of coaching and resistant to change, yet desperate to save his legacy. He tests Helena's ability to translate abstract concepts into practical reality.
- **Tobias 'Tobi' Richter** (Supporter): Helena's husband and a systems engineer. He created the physical prototype of the WATCH to help Helena, though its AI evolution baffles him. Literal-minded and supportive, he grounds Helena in physical reality when she gets too lost in the abstract nuances of coaching.


# Setting
Helena operates internationally, splitting her time between her hometown of Shanghai and a small, picturesque town in Germany. Her goal is to build a life that seamlessly bridges these two cultures while pursuing a new career in transformational coaching, leaving behind the rigid structure of the corporate world.

# Theme
The Silent Language of Structure. The storyline focuses on the disconnect between Helena's intellectual expertise and the messy reality of human emotion. As she takes on her first client, the narrative explores how the AI WATCH teaches her to read the 'source code' of human experience—posture, breathing, and linguistic patterns—without ever explicitly naming them as NLP. It is a journey from trying to force change through logic to facilitating change through observation and rapport.

# The Glitch (Inciting Incident / Motif)
The Dough Wall. Helena's first official session with Klaus Eichel is a disaster. She attempts to apply a high-level corporate SWOT analysis to his struggling family bakery, but Klaus shuts down, crossing his arms and refusing to engage. Feeling her authority slipping and panic rising, Helena's WATCH vibrates—not with a text, but with a slow, rhythmic pulse against her wrist. It displays a simple, abstract visual matching Klaus's slow breathing rate. This intervention forces Helena to stop talking, drop her 'professional' tempo, and unconsciously learn the skill of 'pacing' to re-establish connection, turning a near-failure into a breakthrough.

# Task
Create a 4-week timeline.
For each week, describe the key events, emotional beats, and how the "glitch" manifests or evolves.
Format the output as Markdown.

## Output
Here is the 4-week timeline for *FixedWorld*, structured to guide Helena from rigid corporate logic to intuitive flow.

# Timeline: FixedWorld

## Week 1: The Dough Wall (Pacing & Leading)

**Focus:** The collision of Corporate Logic vs. Human Reality.

*   **Key Events:**
    *   **The Setup:** Helena prepares for her first official coaching session with **Klaus Eichel**. She spends hours creating a pristine slide deck, treating the bakery's failing revenue like a Q3 corporate deficit.
    *   **The Incident:** In the dusty back office of the bakery, Helena presents her SWOT analysis. Klaus is overwhelmed and defensive. He physically closes off—arms crossed, leaning back, breathing heavy and slow. He dismisses her "fancy charts."
    *   **The Failure:** Helena tries to talk faster and louder to regain control (a "Mismatch"). Klaus nearly walks out.
    *   **The Debrief:** Helena vents to **AGG** (the cat) that evening, complaining that Klaus is "stubborn." **Tobias** checks the WATCH's logs, confused by a spike in data during the silence of the meeting.

*   **Emotional Beats:**
    *   High confidence (hubris) → Confusion → Panic → Humility.

*   **The Glitch (The WATCH's Intervention):**
    *   **Manifestation:** As Helena spirals during the meeting, the WATCH vibrates with a slow, heavy thrum—*thump... pause... thump*. The screen displays a single, expanding and contracting gray circle.
    *   **Lesson:** The rhythm matches Klaus’s slow, angry breathing. It forces Helena to unconsciously slow her own rapid, shallow breathing to match the device. This "Pacing" lowers the tension in the room, stopping Klaus from leaving, though the session ends awkwardly.

## Week 2: The Hollow Echo (Representational Systems)

**Focus:** Substance vs. Style, and the words we use to build our world.

*   **Key Events:**
    *   **The Contrast:** **Sophie 'Trend' Chen** goes viral with a video about "Manifesting Your Billions," using flashy, high-energy visual metaphors ("Picture this," "See your future"). Helena feels invisible and outdated.
    *   **The Encounter:** Helena meets **Lars Weber** for coffee. He subtly undermines her new path, using "solid" and "heavy" language ("firm ground," "hard numbers," "grasp the reality"). Helena feels physically weighed down by the conversation but can't articulate why.
    *   **The Practice:** Helena tries to teach AGG about "communication channels," realizing she was speaking "Corporate" (Auditary-Digital) while Klaus was speaking "Legacy" (Kinesthetic/Feeling).

*   **Emotional Beats:**
    *   Insecurity → Frustration → Analytical curiosity.

*   **The Glitch (The WATCH's Intervention):**
    *   **Manifestation:** During the coffee with Lars, the WATCH heats up slightly every time Lars uses a limiting or "heavy" word. It projects a color code on the screen: Blue for Lars (Cold/Rigid) vs. Red for Sophie (Flashy/Visual).
    *   **Lesson:** Helena realizes people speak different "languages" based on their sensory preference. She sees that Lars isn't just "being mean"; he is stuck in a heavy, kinesthetic reality. To move him (or Klaus), she must speak their language first.

## Week 3: The Broken Machine (State Management & Anchoring)

**Focus:** Internal States and the Crisis of Faith.

*   **Key Events:**
    *   **The Crisis:** A critical 50-year-old oven breaks at the bakery. Klaus is in a state of despair, convinced this is the "sign" to give up. He is paralyzed, looping in a negative state.
    *   **The Temptation:** Lars sends a formal contract offer. The salary is immense. It promises to fix the "broken machine" of Helena's own financial anxiety.
    *   **The Conflict:** Helena visits the bakery. Tobi is there, literally fixing the machine, while Helena must fix the man. She tries to cheer Klaus up, but he drags her down into his depression.

*   **Emotional Beats:**
    *   Despair (vicarious) → Temptation (to quit) → Determination.

*   **The Glitch (The WATCH's Intervention):**
    *   **Manifestation:** The WATCH buzzes frantically, not in a rhythm, but in a chaotic static pattern. It displays a "State Alert," visualizing Klaus's stuck mindset as a tightly knotted wire.
    *   **Lesson:** The WATCH prompts Helena to *break* the pattern. She physically moves Klaus to a different chair (Spatial Anchoring) and asks him to recall the specific moment he baked his best loaf of bread. The WATCH settles into a smooth hum as Klaus accesses a resourceful state. Helena learns she cannot fight darkness with logic; she must "anchor" him to a time when he was strong.

## Week 4: The Source Code (Integration)

**Focus:** transcending the tools; the magic becomes invisible.

*   **Key Events:**
    *   **The Test:** Klaus agrees to a "grand reopening" event to launch a new product line that honors tradition but invites the modern crowd (bridging the Germany/Shanghai influence).
    *   **The Climax:** Sophie 'Trend' Chen shows up (perhaps invited by a relative), threatening to turn the event into a superficial spectacle. Klaus begins to retreat into his shell.
    *   **The Resolution:** Helena steps in. She doesn't use slides. She doesn't use jargon. She uses Klaus's *history* (Storytelling) and Sophie's *energy* (Visuals) to weave a narrative that captivates the room. She declines Lars's offer via text message before the speech ends.

*   **Emotional Beats:**
    *   Anxiety → Flow State → Liberation.

*   **The Glitch (The WATCH's Intervention):**
    *   **Manifestation:** As Helena speaks, she glances at her wrist. The WATCH is blank. Or rather, it displays a simple, steady "green" pulse—a heartbeat.
    *   **Lesson:** There is no glitch. The AI has nothing to correct because Helena is perfectly calibrated to the room's feedback loop. She realizes the "magic" wasn't in the device, but in her ability to observe the silent language of structure. She has moved from "doing" coaching to "being" a catalyst.
