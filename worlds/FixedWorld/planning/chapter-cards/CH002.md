# CH002 — The Dough Wall

## Summary
Helena's first coaching session hits a dead end when her corporate jargon alienates the client, forcing her to rely on her WATCH's rhythmic guidance to establish a non-verbal connection.

## Chapter Card
**Glitch (Concrete):** The WATCH vibrates a slow, hypnotic 60 bpm pulse against her wrist, displaying a blue oscillating wave that forces Helena to abandon her frantic speaking tempo and match the client's rhythm.
**Featured Relationship:** Helena & Klaus Eichel
**Nexus Nudge:**
*   *Question:* "Signal interference detected. Are you broadcasting or receiving?"
*   *Micro-task:* "Calibrate output. Match target frequency."
**Real-World Test:** Helena physically closes her laptop mid-pitch, stops talking, and consciously synchronizes her breathing with the WATCH's pulse to mirror Klaus's closed-off posture until he relaxes.
**External Plot Movement:** Klaus moves from physical rejection (crossing arms, leaning back) to emotional vulnerability, admitting the core issue isn't business strategy but his own loss of purpose.
**Ending Beat:** Helena sits in her car, exhausted but electrified, realizing her carefully prepared SWOT analysis was useless, but her silence was powerful.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Include the Glitch motif (The WATCH's somatic intervention).
- [ ] Advance the plot point: The first coaching session transforms from failure to breakthrough.
- [ ] Develop character: Helena realizes her corporate toolkit is insufficient for human problems.
