Based on the provided **FixedWorld Timeline**, **Chapter 005** corresponds to **Day 10: The Hollow Mirror**. This beat focuses on the contrast between surface-level "content" (Sophie's viral fame) and deep "structure" (Helena's difficult work), highlighting the theme of **Signal vs. Noise**.

Here is the Chapter Card:

# CH005 — The Hollow Mirror

## Summary
Helena battles professional jealousy while doom-scrolling Sophie Chen’s viral but vacuous content, triggering a "High Cognitive Dissonance" warning from the WATCH that forces her to distinguish between popularity (noise) and competence (signal).

## Chapter Card
**Glitch (Concrete):** While Helena scrolls through Sophie's frenetic, high-energy videos, the WATCH doesn't just vibrate; it strobes an erratic, jarring rhythm that mismatches her resting heart rate, physically manifesting the dissonance between her internal state and the external input. It displays a "High Signal-to-Noise Ratio" alert.
**Featured Relationship:** Helena and Sophie 'Trend' Chen (via digital interface).
**Nexus Nudge:** The WATCH interrupts the scrolling with a query overlay: *"Object detected: Menu. Object missing: Meal. Proceed?"*
**Real-World Test:** Helena attempts to record her own video to "compete" with Sophie using the same "hype" style. She fails miserably—feeling fake and stiff. The WATCH flatlines (zero engagement feedback) until she stops acting and speaks normally/calmly to herself, at which point it pulses a steady, confirming beat.
**External Plot Movement:** Sophie releases a "Manifest Your CEO Mindset" video that goes viral, directly contradicting the hard, messy work Helena is doing with Klaus.
**Ending Beat:** Helena deletes her drafted "hype" video. She turns off the phone and picks up a notebook to sketch out a structural diagram for Klaus, choosing the quiet work over the loud noise.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Include the Glitch motif (The Strobe/Dissonance Alert)
- [ ] Advance the plot point: Helena rejects the "Influencer" path to focus on "Deep Work."
- [ ] Develop character: Helena's insecurity about her new path vs. her old status is exposed but managed.
