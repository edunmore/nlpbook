Based on the provided **Timeline: The Silent Language of Structure**, **Chapter 003** corresponds to **Day 3: The Glitch (Inciting Incident)**. This is the pivotal moment where Helena's corporate methods fail, and she is forced to rely on the WATCH's bio-feedback to connect with her client.

# CH003 — The Dough Wall

## Summary
Helena’s first coaching session with Klaus Eichel hits a wall of resistance until the WATCH intervenes, teaching her to pace his breathing instead of forcing her corporate agenda.

## Chapter Card
**Glitch (Concrete):** As Helena panics during the silence, the WATCH vibrates a slow, rhythmic 60bpm pulse against her wrist and displays a blue oscillating wave that perfectly matches Klaus’s slow, shallow breathing.
**Featured Relationship:** Helena & Klaus Eichel (Client)
**Nexus Nudge:** 
*   **Question:** "Is the signal being received?"
*   **Micro-task:** "Sync with the external rhythm."
**Real-World Test:** Helena physically stops her pitch, drops her shoulders, and consciously slows her own breathing to match the blue wave on the screen, effectively mirroring Klaus.
**External Plot Movement:** The tension in the room breaks; Klaus uncrosses his arms, sighs deeply, and finally admits the emotional truth behind his business struggles ("I don't need a strategy...").
**Ending Beat:** Helena steps out of the bakery into the cool German air, the WATCH quiet, realizing that doing "nothing" (silence) achieved more than her entire prepared presentation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Include the Glitch motif (The Watch's rhythmic intervention)
- [ ] Advance the plot point: Helena secures her first breakthrough not with logic, but with rapport.
- [ ] Develop character: Show Helena's discomfort with losing control and her reliance on the device.
