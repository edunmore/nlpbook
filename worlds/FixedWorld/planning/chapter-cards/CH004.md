I will start by checking the existing chapter map and chapter cards to ensure alignment with the project structure and to confirm the exact placement of Chapter 4 within the narrative arc.
I'll quickly check the content of `planning/chapter-cards/CH003.md` to see if it has already been updated to the new "FixedWorld" storyline. This will help me ensure continuity with the previous chapters before generating the card for Chapter 004.
# CH004 — The Dough Wall

## Summary
Helena’s first coaching session with Klaus hits a dead end until the WATCH interrupts her high-speed pitch, guiding her to pace his breathing and unlock real connection.

## Chapter Card
**Glitch (Concrete):** The WATCH vibrates a slow, hypnotic rhythm (60 bpm) and displays a blue oscillating wave on its face, clashing with Helena's rapid-fire speaking tempo.
**Featured Relationship:** Helena & Klaus Eichel
**Nexus Nudge:** The WATCH does not offer text advice; it simply pulses. The implicit command is: *Sync with this.*
**Real-World Test:** Helena is forced to abandon her SWOT analysis script. She physically slows her breathing to match the haptic pulse, mirroring Klaus’s posture and silence.
**External Plot Movement:** Klaus uncrosses his arms, sighs deeply, and admits the core truth: "I don't need a strategy; I need to know why I still care."
**Ending Beat:** Helena leaves the bakery, shaken. She looks at the WATCH, realizing it didn't help her *do* something; it stopped her from doing the wrong thing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Include the Glitch motif (The WATCH acts as a somatic metronome).
- [ ] Advance the plot point: The first breakthrough with the pilot client (Klaus).
- [ ] Develop character: Show Helena's struggle to let go of her "Corporate Expert" mask.
- [ ] Illustrate the concept of "Pacing and Leading" without using the technical term.
