I will now generate the Chapter Card for Chapter 001 based on the provided world configuration and timeline.

# CH001 — The Spreadsheet Trap

## Summary
Helena meticulously prepares a high-level corporate strategy for her first client, Klaus Eichel, only to have her rigid preparation challenged when Tobi gifts her the WATCH prototype.

## Chapter Card
**Glitch (Concrete):** The WATCH’s screen flickers, momentarily replacing Helena’s complex Excel formulas with a single, oscillating blue line that pulses at a tempo slightly slower than her frantic typing.
**Featured Relationship:** Helena and Tobi (Husband).
**Nexus Nudge:** 
- **Question:** Is the map the bakery, or just the recipe?
- **Micro-task:** Stop typing and count three breaths of the room.
**Real-World Test:** Helena attempts to explain her "Market Synergy Quadrant" to AGG the cat; the cat’s immediate departure from the room highlights the lack of engagement in her delivery.
**External Plot Movement:** Helena completes a 40-slide SWOT analysis for the Eichel Bakery; Tobi arrives home and officially gifts her the WATCH, explaining its "beta" nature for pattern recognition.
**Ending Beat:** Helena stares at the silent WATCH on her wrist, noticing that as her heart rate slows, the device emits a single, warm haptic thrum of approval.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Establish the "Fixed World" mindset through Helena’s over-reliance on corporate tools (Excel, SWOT).
- [ ] Introduce the WATCH as a physical object and its first subtle interaction with Helena’s bio-rhythms.
- [ ] Character Focus: Demonstrate Helena’s anxiety regarding her transition from "Strategic Marketing" to "Transformational Coaching."
