      "description": "A prototype AI-driven wearable gifted by her husband, Tobias. While ostensibly designed for workflow optimization, it operates with an unnerving intuition. Upon its first initialization, it established a near-neural connection, linking with Helena's bio-rhythms and digital footprint instantly. It offers subtle, cryptic, Yoda-like guidance, visualizing invisible behavioral patterns."

  "setting": "Helena operates internationally, splitting her time between her hometown of Shanghai and a small, picturesque town in Germany. Her goal is to build a life that seamlessly bridges these two cultures while pursuing a new career in transformational coaching, leaving behind the rigid structure of the corporate world.",
  "theme": "The Silent Language of Structure. The storyline focuses on the disconnect between Helena's intellectual expertise and the messy reality of human emotion. As she takes on her first client, the narrative explores how the AI WATCH teaches her to read the 'source code' of human experience\u2014posture, breathing, and linguistic patterns\u2014without ever explicitly naming them as NLP. It is a journey from trying to force change through logic to facilitating change through observation and rapport.",

  "glitch_concept": "The Dough Wall. Helena's first official session with Klaus Eichel is a disaster. She attempts to apply a high-level corporate SWOT analysis to his struggling family bakery, but Klaus shuts down, crossing his arms and refusing to engage. Feeling her authority slipping and panic rising, Helena's WATCH vibrates\u2014not with a text, but with a slow, rhythmic pulse against her wrist. It displays a simple, abstract visual matching Klaus's slow breathing rate. This intervention forces Helena to stop talking, drop her 'professional' tempo, and unconsciously learn the skill of 'pacing' to re-establish connection, turning a near-failure into a breakthrough."
